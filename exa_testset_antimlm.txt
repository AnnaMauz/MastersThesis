So a bit about me, why I joined Arbonne & the shocking diet culture. I thought Arbonne could fix the 3 things I was discontented with, my weight, my bank account & my social circle. 
On training calls the NVPs would tell consultants to COMMIT to the plan for 90 days, with NO CHEATING & have a transformation so they can promote the business. It felt like body shaming to me & an unhealthy diet culture. I got down to 125lbs & after ‘relentless encouragement’ from uplines I shared my before & after pictures online but those ended up being used by them to promote THEIR  businesses. If I bumped into someone I hadn’t seen for a while I noticed them looking me up & down, I felt like my body was being scrutinised & like I had to keep my weight down for my business...talk about putting pressure on myself! So I ended up doing the 30 day plan for over a year & basically used any income I made to pay for my products (be a product of the product). You only fail if you quit & nobody wants to fail right? Well in the end I quit before I failed, I realised I don’t like kissing people’s asses just for a sale, being fake & hassling people, ciao...adios...goodbye! #dietculture #antimlm #mlmfail #antimlmmovement #scam #pyramidscheme #toxicpositivity #iweigh

This is Gold @kyliedennison. I avoided Arbonne’s power hour as it was at 5am & I need my sleep & who the hell sends messages at that time anyway. The basis of this training is the same as Arbonne although it was done in a nicer way (still manipulative though) without the swearing, they used upbeat music & love bombing. This is just plain abusive bullying and needs to be reported. @beachbody are you going to address or ignore this? We are waiting & I’m sure your consultants need to know if this is how the business operates. #antimlm #mlmfail #pyramidscheme #scam #antimlmmovement

Thank you to a follower for sending me this. So, if anyone speaks out against MLM’s or is worried about a loved one joining they are ‘Small minded’ & ‘Village Idiots’. This Arbonne consultant also runs ‘bossbabe’ training which she charges hundreds for on the side to con people out of even more $$ #scam #antimlm #antimlmmovement #mlmfail #pyramidscheme

Arbonne has their summer training on Saturday which you pay £30 to register. By registering you get access to a special product promotion which you also have to pay for. How is this a perk of registering, they are trying to make you feel like you have a special deal so that you can pay for this extra product on top of your training. This promotion is only for consultants...YOU ARE THE CUSTOMERS!!! #scam #antimlm #mlmfail #antimlmmovement #pyramidscheme

Arbonne consultants love to inform you that all products other than Arbonne are toxic, this is scare mongering & completely false advertising. Also, better price...um I don’t think so. How is using Arbonne better for the environment?  They have got packaging just like every other product & they encourage product loading. The list on the 2nd slide ‘do you wash your face?’, etc & the strategically placed comment ‘making sure your baby is clean’ is just a little bit obnoxious. #scam #antimlm #antimlmmovement #pyramidscheme #mlmfail #toxicproducts

You will never be the CEO of your own MLM business. Meet the real CEO’s of your MLM.

 ;;; 
Product loading....This consultant is a District Manager which is only the 1st level of Arbonne...the amount of products in this drawer would have definitely contributed to the promotion, I’d like to see her bathroom cabinet too.

So it’s your fault you got into debt...not Arbonne’s & not your uplines’ .  OK so you were the one that placed the order right?! I’ve witnessed a top NVP advising that if you are serious about your business you should purchase a business pack (approx $1300) & Arbonnize your home. You should use the skincare & do the 30 day plan minimum. You can’t sell what you haven’t tried yourself & you should be a product of the product. So I do not agree with this Arbonne consultant. #scam #antimlm #antimlmmovement #pyramidscheme #mlmfail

This is advice from THE TOP ENVP of Arbonne, she’s been in Arbonne for 20 years so making out you can get to her position if you join now is a joke. This post reeks of #toxicpositivity & cult like tactics, work hard, don’t question anything, don’t utter anything negative...ever! Let me know what you think.  Ps...I thought you could build this business in the nooks & crannies of your life in 1 hour a day §woman_shrugging:medium-light_skin_tone§ #scam #mlmfail #antimlm #antimlmmovement #pyramidscheme

Part 2 of Arbonne brainwashing (I mean training)...this gets into making your 100 person list & sending out ‘asks’. It also covers making your vision board which of course will include a White Mercedes Benz & travel to expensive far away places with your new besties. Also, you’ll notice the little comment that it’s easy to go into district manager qualification with your own purchases and hassling your family. #scam #pyramidscheme #mlmfail #antimlmmovement #antimlm

Arbonne training series...stage 3, goal setting & getting your 1st promotion to District Manager. Your upline will push for you to get to DM as quickly as possible but this is a trap...once you are there you MUST continue to hit 2,500 QV every month otherwise you lose your pay rank & status. As you desperately work hard to keep your rank by hassling people & buying products yourself your uplines have a guaranteed 2,500 QV to help them rank up & earn $ off. #scam #mlmfail #antimlmmovement #antimlm #pyramidscheme

I promised to share some of my recruitment cold messages if I reached 1,000 followers, so here they are. I couldn’t even read these a couple of months ago, let alone share them with you but I guess you’ve all given me the confidence to speak out. 
I sent many messages but as you expect none ever came to anything. I’m just lucky most people ignored me & were polite. Please don’t hate me, I actually thought it was a good opportunity at the time, I’m usually switched on with these sorts of things & a good judge of character so not sure what happened to me...brainwashed I guess but that’s not an excuse.  #scam #antimlm #antimlmmovement #pyramidscheme #mlmfail

The latest thing in Arbonne is using more than 1 product to make a ‘healthy cocktail’. Each product is sold in packs of 30 at around $45 -$60 (depending on if you’re IC/PC) So this ‘ Ultimate health and energy drink’ could cost up to around $240!

In Arbonne everyone has a regional group chat with the uplines team. Someone complained about a product being reformulated saying it felt like it was burning their throat. My upline piped up that I didn’t like it either, so I saw this & replied that I agreed & it tasted gross. 

Anyway, I received this voice message from the RVP... ‘Just to let you know please don’t write stuff on that team chat because new people see it and it’s really not ideal. If you don’t like the product speak to me or Arbonne. I don’t know why people are getting these extreme things or how are you are using it I find it fine, just mix it up’.

Umm...I don’t like being told what to say, this did not sit right with me & I was using the bloody stuff as instructed on the bloody packet. I felt like leaving the team chat there & then...why didn’t I? I think I was paranoid that I was seen as the negative one so I removed my message in the team chat. I’m so cross with myself for being weak but looking back at this message it was the same week I had some personal issues going on so didn’t feel strong enough I guess. Now I realise after reading about the BITE model...that yes I was being controlled & manipulated & went deeper than 1 yucky tasting product.

One of the things that gets on my nerves about MLM’s are consultants that put their Upline on a pedestal. They worship them, I’ve seen this in Arbonne, they will bring the biggest earners on stage & cheer for them. Can’t they see that their struggle to the top is what keeps the top earners at the top...the consultants are paying for the uplines lifestyle, holidays & cars that they want for themselves.

Arbonne (US only) have a recycle program which yes is a good thing. However, I feel that Arbonne promotes over consumerism, more so than other nutrition, skincare & cosmetic companies.  Of course they want to sell their products, every company does but when you buy from a brick & mortar shop you don’t need to buy a certain amount of products that month to keep your job or rank up. I tend to lean more towards consume less and recycle rather than consume (& spend) loads and recycle (as the consultant in this picture has).

In the UK Arbonne holds its version of the GTC, (I attended last year). The big reveal will be new products including the Christmas ‘I want it all pack’ which consultants will be encouraged to purchase 3 packs while the conference is on at a 50% discount & possibly with a free gift (which was a naf cheap blanket last year). Because the conference is virtual this year other countries are invited to register & pay for the training too.

Ok, let me know if you find this as shocking as I do...to me it shows that Arbonne is acting underhanded in regards to promoting their ‘30 days to Heathy Living Plan’. They do ‘buy’ people & I’m convinced they hand pick future NVP’s & give them a helping hand, as sometimes their stories just don’t add up. #scam #mlmfail #antimlm #antimlmmovememt #pyramidscheme

I know I’ve said it before but I’ll say it again...the consultants are the customers! Arbonne’s Black Friday is a scam in itself...they just get the consultants hyped up about ‘limited edition’ products that they HAVE to buy if they want to sell them.

The highest up NVP’s in Arbonne in the U.K. hold a Christmas ‘Red Ball’ §woman_dancing:medium-light_skin_tone§ every year (apart from this year) it’s an incentive night out as only Area Managers & above are allowed to attend. However, the lower consultants can purchase a ticket to be there for the after party & pretend they were there all day. They take photos with the ‘famous’ NVP’s to plaster all over their social media to try & entice new recruits on their ‘paid for’ AmaZiNG night out in London. It’s just another opportunity for the higher ups to brainwash the consultants. The tickets sold at the after party are expensive & don’t even include food...so guess who is really paying for the NVP’s party? §thinking_face§#scam #mlmfail #antimlm #pyramidscheme

My personal thoughts on the recent drama...I too used to correspond with said lady for months about Antimlm content.

This Mohun is in debt with her car, (that she was given §woman_facepalming:medium-light_skin_tone§) so she took out a loan to purchase it & Monat pays an amount to cover or part cover the cost of the monthly payments.

Some of the high up NVP’s add extra incentives to their down lines to the make them work harder (or spend more money).

Let’s break this down:-

Be your own boss - no you are a contractor
Earn amazing trips - only if you are in the top 0.01% of Arbonne...even some of the NVP’s don’t manage it
Leverage your time - you will be working unsociable hours for nil guaranteed pay
Build and inspire a team - if you can get anyone to join your team! After you try to recruit your family and friends you will resort to cold messaging which is just embarrassing.
Help others meet their health and nutrition goals - you are not qualified to do this.
Save for a vacation - The only thing you will be buying with your commissions (if any) will be more  products.
Make some extra monthly income - see above

Repost from @ethicalelephant. I’d like to draw your attention to the first one on the list...Yves Rocher not being cruelty free...they own Arbonne. Arbonne pride themselves by their ethics & being a cruelty free brand so why did they sellout to Yves Rocher? #scam #crueltyfree #mlmfail #antimlm #antimlmmovement #pyramidscheme #banthescam

Yes Oops, you are spending more than you earn, I’m not surprised you can’t afford it. Please be aware this is typical of an Arbonne consultant, ordering large boxes of products to showcase or try to sell but struggling financially because only the top 2% will make any money at all.

Someone’s had their feathers ruffled. @charlottenaomi3 knew exactly what she was saying...the truth! We just wish she’d had a little longer on air to put her point across. The fact she was in the business only 4 months does not matter, she’s done her research...I was in the business for 20 months & worked my ass off...is that enough experience for you? §woman_facepalming:medium-light_skin_tone§#scam #pyramidscheme #banthescam #thismorning #reddit #mlmfail #antimlm #antimlmmovement

Reason number 56 why I left Arbonne...disgusting training call §stop_sign§ trigger warning for Abortion §stop_sign§ Wasn’t sure whether to post this but I just wanted to let you know the lengths the consultants have to go to to promote & keep recruiting & the manipulation that goes on inside this business.

If I knew what I know now, would I have sought out WiFi on a beach while on holiday just to watch a Arbonne weekly whipping training call (this picture was the invite). If I’d known that would be my last holiday for who knows how long...a few years at least...would I have ignored my children for even that one hour while they played in the sea with their dad & the rest of the family? I think you know the answer...don’t join a company where you can ‘work anywhere’ or you will just work everywhere. Ps, I was just making this guy richer! #scam #mlmfail #antimlm #antimlmmovement #banthescam #pyramidscheme

This NVP is at the top of Arbonne, looking at the women who have literally helped her get to the top. Has she actually ‘helped’ them though? She will only commit to training you if you purchase £240 worth of products otherwise she’ll be wasting her time as you’re not serious about your business. #scam #banthescam #mlmfail #antimlm #antimlmmovement #pyramidscheme

End of month panic...if you join Arbonne this is the sort of pressure you’ll get on a Sunday night. You must hit your QV at month end (your uplines certainly need too) otherwise, commissions will be lost, cars will be gone & you will lose all respect from all the boss babes of the sisterhood. #pyramidscheme #scam #mlmfail #antimlm #antimlmmovement #banthescam

This isn’t the most shocking of posts from a consultant but I think it’s particularly sad. It looks like she only has friends that support her in her MLM now.
