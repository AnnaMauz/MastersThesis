COLD MESSAGING IS DEAD! Drop a hands up §raising_hands:light_skin_tone§ if you’re with me on this! And SAVE this post for some reminders ;) 

Very quickly after I started my social selling biz I realized I didn’t “fit in” to the cold message invites, posting product pics etc scene. (Actually those are all the reasons I was skeptical to get started in the first place.) 

If you resonate with not fitting into that scene you are MY PEOPLE!!!§woman_raising_hand:light_skin_tone§If the strategies you are being taught go against who you are your core?! Let’s change that§backhand_index_pointing_down:light_skin_tone§

§collision§Boom! There’s a new kid in town. A MODERN and authentic way to build your business. I stepped out of the box and searched for different ways to build online (since I than the ones I was being taught made me nauseous.) I invested, learned, Implemented, and failed my way forward. By doing so, I was able to start attracting dream customers to me §backhand_index_pointing_right:light_skin_tone§which resulted in hitting top leader boards, triple rank advancements in a month, and MOST importantly?! I took what I was doing and launched my company She Breathes Courage Marketing. My mission and jam is helping YOU transform your existing brand and content into a well oiled customer attraction & sales queen machine!§raising_hands:light_skin_tone§

If you are also committed to ditching the§face_vomiting§strategies, I want to remind you:

It takes time, patience, consistency, strategy, & grit to skill up in order to build authentic connections, and create content that connects and converts ....

But you are 1000 percent capable, and it is 1000 percent worth it!!

Cheers to making change in the industry. Rooting for you, and here to help! Ask me your questions about authentically attracting dream customers below§backhand_index_pointing_down:light_skin_tone§

 ;;; 
Are You Leaving Your Business To Chance? You are probably thinking “No way girl! Not me!! I’m working hard, staying consistent, showing up, putting myself out there.” That may be true, but ooof this was a jagged little pill for me to swallow: Consistency, and busy work do not necessarily translate to attracting customers, and making sales. 

Take a serious inventory of what your "End of month hustle" looks like. 
Does it go a little something like this?! 
You sit down and think "Oh crap, I better get some more sales. Crap I am XYZ amount of orders away from my next rank."
So you throw up some product posts. You rack your brain for who you could message. Maybe you even start incentivizing people to purchase. Or asking people to support you because you are SO CLOSE TO YOUR GOAL, and this would mean the world to you.
Listen, I get it! I've been there. But that Is NOT A GOOD or sustainable STRATEGY for consistently attracting and signing dream customers or business partners.

So many of us are out here praying for our businesses to work, thankful that this is an answer to prayer, Or hoping that this is gonna be it, when we DON’T have a PLAN in place to EXECUTE ON to make it a reality! IT TAKES STRATEGY, and understanding how to execute on the things that actually consistently move your business forward. IT TAKES STRATEGY! 

Wait what?! Strategy? Yup, but the name of the game here at She Breathes Courage Marketing is: "Strategy meets authenticity and simplicity." The results you are WANTING in your business are on the other side of DIGGING IN and creating & executing a strategy in your business. 
They are on the other side of DOING THE DAMN WORK THAT YOU ARE AVOIDING.
 
And you know what?! YOU ARE A SMART entrepreneurial spirited kinda woman. WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE THE GRIT TO BUCKLE DOWN AND GET TO WORK ON BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS, and I’ve got the roadmap.

MOST PPL IN THIS INDUSTRY ARE LEAVING THIER BUSINESSES TO CHANCE. And if you have been too (NO SHAME). But, you are drawing your line in the sand RIGHT HERE. RIGHT NOW. YOU ARE FAR too SMART, and your dreams are TOO big to let this be a post and hope business. It’s TIME TO MAKE IT HAPPEN ON PURPOSE.§oncoming_fist:light_skin_tone§

If Slide number #1 is the extent of your business strategy, and what you’ve been taught.. we’ve got a problem, so Let’s chat this out. 

You know you aren’t getting the results you are looking for in your business, and you are beyond frustrated. When you reach out and ask for help you get the old cheerleading speech. “Just keep going, doing the things, and following the system.”§face_with_rolling_eyes§ How you are building your business literally makes you§downcast_face_with_sweat§sweat, §grimacing_face§cringe, & you are spinning your wheels faster than Daisy Duke, but getting NOWHERE. 

Here’s the deal! You are not being taught online marketing. Those strategies are NOT A SUSTAINABLE way to build your business, and consistently attract new customers and make sales. And also ... they just don’t work §grimacing_face§. They may have once worked well .. but it’s 2021. Time for Daisy Duke to get a new car ;) One that will actually MOVE HER BUSINESS FORWARD with simple and authentic strategies. 

Let’s cut the BS, and start making some moves girl! Drop the “just do more of the stuff that actually doesn’t work” and learn how to skill up in your authentic marketing.

“Explain Add Value like I am 5§woman_shrugging:light_skin_tone§§zany_face§§grinning_squinting_face§”

One of my clients said this to me this week. So let’s break this down! You have heard “Add Value” a thousand times and understand the overall idea of it, but when it comes down to what it ACTUALLY looks like for your content, you could use a little more clarity. §thinking_face§

If “sharing“ your story  is something you are still using in your content strategy — it’s not actually attracting anybody.

These are some examples showing a simple tweak you can make to go from:

You focused (me and my story content) 
TO 
Value focused (what’s in it for them content)

One more example: 
“I never used to be able to sleep at night.”
TO
“Here are my top 3 tips for a better night sleep!”

What’s so amazing about this is: it’s the SAME content you initially wanted to share, it just has a spin that will make all the difference in Connection and Conversions!!!

While it may seem like the majority of people think those §backhand_index_pointing_up:light_skin_tone§things about you, here are some TRUTHS about YOU, the person “Crazy” enough to follow your dreams: 
You are BRAVE. 
You are a visionary. 
You are a fierce leader. 
You are a game changer. 
You are a trail blazer. 

You know, I can honestly say I loved my career. I wasn’t looking to get out because I hated it. I just had a desire to do something different. Plain and simple. I love creating, I love coaching, and my career led me to here. 

No matter what the reason, let’s freaking normalize being able to call our own shots. To walk away from things that no longer serve us. From things we outgrow. Or just plain and simple to pursue passions. The ability to to pivot directions.

§stop_sign§Stop leading with the product§stop_sign§

§cross_mark§Your product isn’t it!! Your product is not your target audience, it’s not your niche, it’s not how you add value, and it’s not the problem you are solving.§cross_mark§

Your dream customer is scrolling this app and is bombarded with messaging. As she scrolls, she’s thinking: “what’s in this for me? Is this valuable or helpful to my life in some way? Do I vibe with this girl and what she’s putting out there?! Do I want to keep learning more?!” And she most certainly isn’t jumping on here to be SOLD TO. (Think mall kiosks at Christmas §flushed_face§§zany_face§) There is a better way to share your product, that will actually resonate with ppl instead of them swiping on by a “product post.”

Your job is to make it crystal la Croix clear WHO you are for, what you can help them with, and what kind of content you dish up on your feed. Ask yourself what types of content can you create to enhance her life? 

Example: Let’s say your product is in the Gut Health Industry. Two different scenarios....

1. The products have completely changed your life, but you don’t want to niche down to a “Gut health page.” No problem! Find out what you are really passionate about helping other people with! Maybe its homeschool moms looking to increase energy. Dish out content that adds value to that particular woman. Your daily routine. Your curriculum. Your lunches. Your activities. How you salvage your sanity ;) How you fill up your own cup. Mom humour etc. Awesome! But you still have to monetize your account in some way right? Infuse your product as part of the solution to helping her get her desired outcome!
2. You LOVE gut health, and want to have more of a health account. GREAT! SHARE other value that’s not just your product. Other supplements, nutrition, hormones, etc! And again infuse your product! 

People will Buy what you recommend when they know, like and trust you. And see as someone who adds value, and can help them with something :)
Bottom line! People Buy from people! And people buy solutions NOT products! 
Your product plays second fiddle. NOT YOU!!

Wanna know the SECRET§key§ to attracting dream customers and making sales authentically on social?!

You are consuming ALL The information looking for the hacks, the secrets, the mystery to building your business … 

Lean in! Turns out the “REAL SECRET”? It’s already INSIDE YOU! But the truth is, that it’s easier to just keep looking for “the secret.” Rather than doing the hard work of diving deep into: 

* Getting crystal clear on What you love to do, Who you LOVE to help, and how you can help them. 
* Getting OBSESSED with what your dream customer desires. What keeps her up at night. What she’s struggling with.
* Understanding her, and what value you can dish up to enhance her life.
* Focusing on building your business 1 WOMAN AT A TIME. Help 1 woman, them do that again, and again, and again. 
* Stop focusing on vanity metrics. Every single like, comment, view - that is from a HEARTBEAT on the other side of the screen. That matters. 
* Playing the long game! It takes TIME to build trust. Businesses of IMPACT are NOT built over time. 

You KNOW it is time to DIG INTO THIS, and create your brand and content strategy that is UNIQUE to YOU and YOUR BUSINESS. You are tired of spinning your wheels on social media, and are ready to step into making real impact with your business. You understand you aren’t copy and pasteable, or duplicatable, and desire to step fully into what you have to offer with your business and product. You are tired of snagging every freebie that comes your way, and feeling completely overwhelmed. 

And I’m here! This is my JAM. This is my superpower in business. And you know you are ready to work with me. (Swipe to see what some of clients say§smiling_face_with_hearts§) You know you need this, and deserve this! Clarity and confidence in how to attract your dream customers and authentically make sales is EVERYTHING!

1 question you can ask yourself today to get over the fear of selling:
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
a pastor of mine said you can ask this if you want to know what you're supposed to do in life- it's this:
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
"what breaks your heart?"
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
if you are sell something, that means you have a solution to someones problem.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
be honest, does their problem break your heart? 
→are they spending more time away from their family than they want to?
→are they in physical pain on the verge of a health crisis?
→ do they make excuses not to go out in public because they're embarrassed of their skin?
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
if it does break your heart and you're STILL worried people will think you're greedy/trying too hard/etc... that is YOU focusing on YOU. and that's the real problem.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
the most selfless thing you can do is focus on THEIR transformation, not YOUR transaction.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
sales is others focused not you focused. it's the greatest irony of business.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
"you'll get everything you want in life if you will just help enough other people get what they want." - zig ziglar 
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
their transformation will actually transform YOU. into the kind of business owner/leader that puts others first. your growth is simply the fruit of it. not the cause of it.

§backhand_index_pointing_down§The Best Way To FIND YOUR NICHE! (SAVE THIS POST & FOLLOW FOR MORE)

This is BY FAR the # 1 reason social sellers, coaches, consultants, service-providers stay stuck & broke in a sea of potential clients...

Maybe you're thinking, "BUT I ALREADY HAVE A NICHE!" - while that might be true in theory... the reality is that the PROOF IS IN THE PUDDING. 

If you're not:
§cross_mark§ growing an audience full of ideal clients
§cross_mark§ getting human engagement on your posts
§cross_mark§ blowing up with DM's from potential clients on the regular... 

You need a niche, stat! 

But how do you identify a profitable niche that you can become the go-to expert in? 

Here's a glimpse into our "Niches to Riches" process:

⁣⁣§keycap:1§ Market - start with the general industry you're in: like health, fitness, business. For now, let's choose health.⁣⁣

§keycap:2§ Submarket - examine the categories WITHIN that industry. Health includes: nutrition, vegan, disordered eating, mental health, etc. ⁣THIS is where 99% of coaches & consultants get stuck... thinking you have a niche, but you’re actually floating in the sub-market abyss. §loudly_crying_face§

⁣⁣§keycap:3§ Niche - identify the special segment you're the expert in!⁣ this is a specific person (entity or business) with a specific problem. 

§cross_mark§ NOT A NICHE: "women"

⁣§check_mark_button§A GOOD NICHE: "new moms with depleted hormones, exhaustion, and brain fog who need a custom protocol to rebalance their body."
 

See the difference? 

⁣If you want to make a serious impact (and $), prioritize finding your niche IMMEDIATELY. Everyday you waste "trying to figure it out" is another day your ideal clients go without the help & answers they need. 

A clear niche is the difference between where your business is at right now... and where you want it to be. §money_bag§

What you believe, shapes the reality of your future. SAVE THIS REMINDER! 

I’ve been thinking a lot about the tips I share on this page to help social sellers attract customers + sell on social media. I’ve said this before but I’m gonna say it again. YES, strategy and a roadmap matter! But you know what else matters? YOUR BELIEFS. Your vision. Your daily thoughts. This is an area where I actually see my clients struggle a lot in their business. (And it’s one of the things I wrestle with the most also.) 

So, I decided to commit myself to a 30 day mindset challenge, and I’m inviting you to join me. It’ll take place in my stories, and we’ll start tomorrow! §red_heart§ If ya know you need this, and want to join me drop a §seedling§ in the comments, and tag a fellow social seller to join us!

A new or current follower does NOT WANT TO jump on this app and be sold to. They will very quickly be able to determine if you are someone who provides value to them, or if they are gonna try and be “sold” too.

To the woman struggling to balance it all … I’ve been you. 
To the woman who’s anxiety shakes her entire life … I’ve been you.
To the woman who’s struggling with body image postpartum … I’ve been you. 
To the woman who doesn’t feel qualified enough, good enough, talented enough … I’ve been you. 

Slowly I started making changes, and started growing more than I could ever imagine. Sometimes it feels like its two steps forward, and then 4 steps back. 
But I want you to know? You can slowly start digging yourself out. I don’t have it all figured out, and will never pretend too. But I sure as heck can sure what I’m learning, and CHEER YOU ON on your own journey!

COLD MESSAGING IS DEAD! Drop a hands up §raising_hands:light_skin_tone§ if you’re with me on this! And SAVE this post for some reminders ;) 

Very quickly after I started my social selling biz I realized I didn’t “fit in” to the cold message invites, posting product pics etc scene. (Actually those are all the reasons I was skeptical to get started in the first place.) 

If you resonate with not fitting into that scene you are MY PEOPLE!!!§woman_raising_hand:light_skin_tone§If the strategies you are being taught go against who you are your core?! Let’s change that§backhand_index_pointing_down:light_skin_tone§

§collision§Boom! There’s a new kid in town. A MODERN and authentic way to build your business. I stepped out of the box and searched for different ways to build online (since I than the ones I was being taught made me nauseous.) I invested, learned, Implemented, and failed my way forward. By doing so, I was able to start attracting dream customers to me §backhand_index_pointing_right:light_skin_tone§which resulted in hitting top leader boards, triple rank advancements in a month, and MOST importantly?! I took what I was doing and launched my company She Breathes Courage Marketing. My mission and jam is helping YOU transform your existing brand and content into a well oiled customer attraction & sales queen machine!§raising_hands:light_skin_tone§

If you are also committed to ditching the§face_vomiting§strategies, I want to remind you:

It takes time, patience, consistency, strategy, & grit to skill up in order to build authentic connections, and create content that connects and converts ....

But you are 1000 percent capable, and it is 1000 percent worth it!!

Cheers to making change in the industry. Rooting for you, and here to help! Ask me your questions about authentically attracting dream customers below§backhand_index_pointing_down:light_skin_tone§

 ;;; 
Are You Leaving Your Business To Chance? You are probably thinking “No way girl! Not me!! I’m working hard, staying consistent, showing up, putting myself out there.” That may be true, but ooof this was a jagged little pill for me to swallow: Consistency, and busy work do not necessarily translate to attracting customers, and making sales. 

Take a serious inventory of what your "End of month hustle" looks like. 
Does it go a little something like this?! 
You sit down and think "Oh crap, I better get some more sales. Crap I am XYZ amount of orders away from my next rank."
So you throw up some product posts. You rack your brain for who you could message. Maybe you even start incentivizing people to purchase. Or asking people to support you because you are SO CLOSE TO YOUR GOAL, and this would mean the world to you.
Listen, I get it! I've been there. But that Is NOT A GOOD or sustainable STRATEGY for consistently attracting and signing dream customers or business partners.

So many of us are out here praying for our businesses to work, thankful that this is an answer to prayer, Or hoping that this is gonna be it, when we DON’T have a PLAN in place to EXECUTE ON to make it a reality! IT TAKES STRATEGY, and understanding how to execute on the things that actually consistently move your business forward. IT TAKES STRATEGY! 

Wait what?! Strategy? Yup, but the name of the game here at She Breathes Courage Marketing is: "Strategy meets authenticity and simplicity." The results you are WANTING in your business are on the other side of DIGGING IN and creating & executing a strategy in your business. 
They are on the other side of DOING THE DAMN WORK THAT YOU ARE AVOIDING.
 
And you know what?! YOU ARE A SMART entrepreneurial spirited kinda woman. WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE THE GRIT TO BUCKLE DOWN AND GET TO WORK ON BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS, and I’ve got the roadmap.

MOST PPL IN THIS INDUSTRY ARE LEAVING THIER BUSINESSES TO CHANCE. And if you have been too (NO SHAME). But, you are drawing your line in the sand RIGHT HERE. RIGHT NOW. YOU ARE FAR too SMART, and your dreams are TOO big to let this be a post and hope business. It’s TIME TO MAKE IT HAPPEN ON PURPOSE.§oncoming_fist:light_skin_tone§

Here’s the deal! You are not being taught online marketing. Those strategies are NOT A SUSTAINABLE way to build your business, and consistently attract new customers and make sales. And also ... they just don’t work §grimacing_face§. They may have once worked well .. but it’s 2021. Time for Daisy Duke to get a new car ;) One that will actually MOVE HER BUSINESS FORWARD with simple and authentic strategies.

“Explain Add Value like I am 5§woman_shrugging:light_skin_tone§§zany_face§§grinning_squinting_face§”

One of my clients said this to me this week. So let’s break this down! You have heard “Add Value” a thousand times and understand the overall idea of it, but when it comes down to what it ACTUALLY looks like for your content, you could use a little more clarity. §thinking_face§

If “sharing“ your story  is something you are still using in your content strategy — it’s not actually attracting anybody.

These are some examples showing a simple tweak you can make to go from:

You focused (me and my story content) 
TO 
Value focused (what’s in it for them content)

One more example: 
“I never used to be able to sleep at night.”
TO
“Here are my top 3 tips for a better night sleep!”

What’s so amazing about this is: it’s the SAME content you initially wanted to share, it just has a spin that will make all the difference in Connection and Conversions!!!

While it may seem like the majority of people think those §backhand_index_pointing_up:light_skin_tone§things about you, here are some TRUTHS about YOU, the person “Crazy” enough to follow your dreams: 
You are BRAVE. 
You are a visionary. 
You are a fierce leader. 
You are a game changer. 
You are a trail blazer. 

You know, I can honestly say I loved my career. I wasn’t looking to get out because I hated it. I just had a desire to do something different. Plain and simple. I love creating, I love coaching, and my career led me to here. 

No matter what the reason, let’s freaking normalize being able to call our own shots. To walk away from things that no longer serve us. From things we outgrow. Or just plain and simple to pursue passions. The ability to to pivot directions.

§stop_sign§Stop leading with the product§stop_sign§

§cross_mark§Your product isn’t it!! Your product is not your target audience, it’s not your niche, it’s not how you add value, and it’s not the problem you are solving.§cross_mark§

Your dream customer is scrolling this app and is bombarded with messaging. As she scrolls, she’s thinking: “what’s in this for me? Is this valuable or helpful to my life in some way? Do I vibe with this girl and what she’s putting out there?! Do I want to keep learning more?!” And she most certainly isn’t jumping on here to be SOLD TO. (Think mall kiosks at Christmas §flushed_face§§zany_face§) There is a better way to share your product, that will actually resonate with ppl instead of them swiping on by a “product post.”

Your job is to make it crystal la Croix clear WHO you are for, what you can help them with, and what kind of content you dish up on your feed. Ask yourself what types of content can you create to enhance her life? 

Example: Let’s say your product is in the Gut Health Industry. Two different scenarios....

1. The products have completely changed your life, but you don’t want to niche down to a “Gut health page.” No problem! Find out what you are really passionate about helping other people with! Maybe its homeschool moms looking to increase energy. Dish out content that adds value to that particular woman. Your daily routine. Your curriculum. Your lunches. Your activities. How you salvage your sanity ;) How you fill up your own cup. Mom humour etc. Awesome! But you still have to monetize your account in some way right? Infuse your product as part of the solution to helping her get her desired outcome!
2. You LOVE gut health, and want to have more of a health account. GREAT! SHARE other value that’s not just your product. Other supplements, nutrition, hormones, etc! And again infuse your product! 

People will Buy what you recommend when they know, like and trust you. And see as someone who adds value, and can help them with something :)
Bottom line! People Buy from people! And people buy solutions NOT products! 
Your product plays second fiddle. NOT YOU!!

Wanna know the SECRET§key§ to attracting dream customers and making sales authentically on social?!

You are consuming ALL The information looking for the hacks, the secrets, the mystery to building your business … 

Lean in! Turns out the “REAL SECRET”? It’s already INSIDE YOU! But the truth is, that it’s easier to just keep looking for “the secret.” Rather than doing the hard work of diving deep into: 

* Getting crystal clear on What you love to do, Who you LOVE to help, and how you can help them. 
* Getting OBSESSED with what your dream customer desires. What keeps her up at night. What she’s struggling with.
* Understanding her, and what value you can dish up to enhance her life.
* Focusing on building your business 1 WOMAN AT A TIME. Help 1 woman, them do that again, and again, and again. 
* Stop focusing on vanity metrics. Every single like, comment, view - that is from a HEARTBEAT on the other side of the screen. That matters. 
* Playing the long game! It takes TIME to build trust. Businesses of IMPACT are NOT built over time. 

You KNOW it is time to DIG INTO THIS, and create your brand and content strategy that is UNIQUE to YOU and YOUR BUSINESS. You are tired of spinning your wheels on social media, and are ready to step into making real impact with your business. You understand you aren’t copy and pasteable, or duplicatable, and desire to step fully into what you have to offer with your business and product. You are tired of snagging every freebie that comes your way, and feeling completely overwhelmed. 

And I’m here! This is my JAM. This is my superpower in business. And you know you are ready to work with me.

1 question you can ask yourself today to get over the fear of selling:
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
a pastor of mine said you can ask this if you want to know what you're supposed to do in life- it's this:
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
"what breaks your heart?"
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
if you are sell something, that means you have a solution to someones problem.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
be honest, does their problem break your heart? 
→are they spending more time away from their family than they want to?
→are they in physical pain on the verge of a health crisis?
→ do they make excuses not to go out in public because they're embarrassed of their skin?
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
if it does break your heart and you're STILL worried people will think you're greedy/trying too hard/etc... that is YOU focusing on YOU. and that's the real problem.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
the most selfless thing you can do is focus on THEIR transformation, not YOUR transaction.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
sales is others focused not you focused. it's the greatest irony of business.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
"you'll get everything you want in life if you will just help enough other people get what they want." - zig ziglar 
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
their transformation will actually transform YOU. into the kind of business owner/leader that puts others first. your growth is simply the fruit of it. not the cause of it.

§backhand_index_pointing_down§The Best Way To FIND YOUR NICHE! (SAVE THIS POST & FOLLOW FOR MORE)

This is BY FAR the # 1 reason social sellers, coaches, consultants, service-providers stay stuck & broke in a sea of potential clients...

Maybe you're thinking, "BUT I ALREADY HAVE A NICHE!" - while that might be true in theory... the reality is that the PROOF IS IN THE PUDDING. 

If you're not:
§cross_mark§ growing an audience full of ideal clients
§cross_mark§ getting human engagement on your posts
§cross_mark§ blowing up with DM's from potential clients on the regular... 

You need a niche, stat! 

But how do you identify a profitable niche that you can become the go-to expert in? 

Here's a glimpse into our "Niches to Riches" process:

⁣⁣§keycap:1§ Market - start with the general industry you're in: like health, fitness, business. For now, let's choose health.⁣⁣

§keycap:2§ Submarket - examine the categories WITHIN that industry. Health includes: nutrition, vegan, disordered eating, mental health, etc. ⁣THIS is where 99% of coaches & consultants get stuck... thinking you have a niche, but you’re actually floating in the sub-market abyss. §loudly_crying_face§

⁣⁣§keycap:3§ Niche - identify the special segment you're the expert in!⁣ this is a specific person (entity or business) with a specific problem. 

§cross_mark§ NOT A NICHE: "women"

⁣§check_mark_button§A GOOD NICHE: "new moms with depleted hormones, exhaustion, and brain fog who need a custom protocol to rebalance their body."
 

See the difference? 

⁣If you want to make a serious impact (and $), prioritize finding your niche IMMEDIATELY. Everyday you waste "trying to figure it out" is another day your ideal clients go without the help & answers they need. 

A clear niche is the difference between where your business is at right now... and where you want it to be. §money_bag§ 

Struggling to find yours? 

§backhand_index_pointing_down§Drop your niche (or what you think it is) in the comments if you want direction from a niching pro §upside-down_face§

What you believe, shapes the reality of your future. SAVE THIS REMINDER! 

I’ve been thinking a lot about the tips I share on this page to help social sellers attract customers + sell on social media. I’ve said this before but I’m gonna say it again. YES, strategy and a roadmap matter! But you know what else matters? YOUR BELIEFS. Your vision. Your daily thoughts. This is an area where I actually see my clients struggle a lot in their business. (And it’s one of the things I wrestle with the most also.) 

So, I decided to commit myself to a 30 day mindset challenge, and I’m inviting you to join me. It’ll take place in my stories, and we’ll start tomorrow! §red_heart§ If ya know you need this, and want to join me drop a §seedling§ in the comments, and tag a fellow social seller to join us! 

Always cheerin ya on! §party_popper§

“Watch your thoughts, they become your words.
Watch your words, they become your actions.
Watch your actions, they become your habits.
Watch your habits, they become your character.
Watch your character, it becomes your destiny.”
-Lao Tzu 

Who’s down for lining up their thoughts, and words with their dreams?!§woman_raising_hand:light_skin_tone§ I’m curious - is this already something you do in your biz?

 ;;; 
Are you making this mistake in your social selling biz? Neglecting your personal brand?! You may think oh no way, for SURE NOT! But take a quick look at your feed, and your stories!
Is the majority company photos?! §face_screaming_in_fear§
Stock images? §anxious_face_with_sweat§
Constantly promoting? §fearful_face§ 

A new or current follower does NOT WANT TO jump on this app and be sold to. They will very quickly be able to determine if you are someone who provides value to them, or if they are gonna try and be “sold” too. 

Remember! People buy solutions! Not products! So provide value, and offer solutions §clapping_hands:medium-light_skin_tone§§star-struck§ 

Do you know how to add value and provide solutions around your product?! If not drop it in the comments, and we’ll brainstorm! §star-struck§

“Listen, I was created to do BIG things!

I was NOT created to constantly worry about keeping everyone around me comfortable.

I was NOT created to constantly worry about what others think of me.

I’ve got goals to accomplish, & dreams I want to see unfold.

Life is too short to not go for the things our heart desires.

Not only was I created to do BIG things, so are YOU!!

What is or has been tugging at your heart??

Wake up friends!!

TODAY I challenge you to just go for it!! §rocket§ §beating_heart§§dizzy§
