 Post Nr. 1 

felt a bit shy posting these pics and choosing which pics to post because i felt so many of them weren’t “good enough.”

thinking about it now, i was criticising myself before anyone else could have.

so screw it, this is me in all these pics and i’m learning to love myself more and more each day §sparkling_heart§ @loungeunderwear #gifted

it’s been a while since a @youthtothepeople product has made its way into my routine. i had really great luck with the brand in 2019 and several of their products made it into my “best of” list for that year. i especially love their cleaner and adaptogen moisturizer. §hugging_face§
•
but, their recent releases have left me wanting more (or less haha). their kombucha toner left an odd residue on my skin/didn’t exfoliate that well and their face scrub was way too harsh for me. unfortunately, the 15% vitamin c + clean caffeine energy serum is another miss for me. §crying_face§
•
the slightly creamy/gel-like serum is packed with vitamin in the form of 3-0 ethyl ascorbic acid, tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate, and magnesium ascorbyl phosphate. these are all considered vitamin c “derivatives” which still have some progress before being hailed as better alternatives to good old l ascorbic acid (at least from what i have read/researched which is fairly minimal haha). §man_shrugging:medium_skin_tone§
•
still, i appreciate these derivatives for offering some mild brightening and cosmetic “glow-y” look and this serum delivers in that regard. even though this product did leave a slight residue on my skin...it also left a nice brightened look behind that carried on for a good portion of the day (especially when paired with a brightening essence). §face_with_monocle§
•
over the course of the past few weeks though...i noticed my skin looking more textured and congested. i decided to remove the 15% vitamin c + clean caffeine energy serum from my routine and things started to even out. working it back in...and the issues returned. §face_with_hand_over_mouth§
•
i’m not sure if this formulation (which also includes yerba mate extract, sodium hyaluronate, and ginger root oil) is just not a good match for my skin, but i just couldn’t use it for much longer than two weeks before things went south. §face_with_raised_eyebrow§
•
the caffeine from the yerba mate might have helped with brightening (and gives this serum an amazing yet subtle earthy/tea scent) alongside the vitamin c...but i didn't notice any major reduction of dark spots or deep hyperpigmentation. once again the glow was more cosmetic and superficial than anything else. §face_with_monocle§

are you surprised that i’m at at a playground?§face_savoring_food§⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
since there’s 4 pics of me, i thought i’d share 4 tips for how to attracted optimistic energy§sparkles§⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
1. writing down the best part of your day!⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
- i’ve been doing this since 2017 and i didn’t realize how it passively made me become more optimistic. each day, no matter how shitty it was, i wrote down what i thought was the best part of my day. sometimes it was something boring too, like what i ate for dinner or wearing my favourite leggings. but it wasn’t about what i was writing, it was the fact that i was looking for something that made me feel good during the day + that i recognized it§memo§⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
2. setting weekly goals!⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
- i can be really forgetful at times, so i started writing down small things i wanted to accomplish for the week. what has made this more enjoyable has been writing down things to do that i love. for instance, this week i wrote down shoot content for instagram, work on passion project, and bake something yummy! see a list of fun activities to do can really perk your mood, especially when you’re bored!§puzzle_piece§⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
3. practicing manifestation!⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
- i practice manifestation with reverse intentions. let’s say i’m anxious about taking a test. to trick my mind into feeling calm, i will write down “i’m going to ace my exam” and repeat the phrase out loud while looking at myself in the mirror until i believe it. the dual nature about this is you force yourself to push aside those negative thoughts and you manifest the phrase into existence§house§⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
4. reflective journaling!⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
- this is the toughest practice i’ve introduced into my life, but super effective when you are going through a hard time. basically, you take a recent unideal situation and make a list of the positive outcomes of it. ex: fighting w a friend. positive outcomes: realization, growth, empathy, etc§thought_balloon§⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
i hope you find my tips helpful :)

​
in my previous post (9 square back), i talked about papa d's family culture where a 4 month old baby will shave botak. ​
​
not only does his family culture requires the baby to be shaven botak, baby also need to sit in a walker, wear a biscuit necklace and we will take the biscuits from the necklace to touch baby's mouth. (swipe over to see the video) ​
​
according to papa d, this represents no drooling for the baby. did any of you also do the same?​

transforming my hair and scalp into their better self with @vivinaturals cbdetox and root 66.⁣
⁣
if neglecting my hair was a crime, i’d be sent to prison. i was very mean to my crowning glory - washing it everyday and not conditioning. i used to only shampoo them because i disliked conditioners, and then brush them wet. *face slap x 2*  no wonder my hair was bad for the past couple of years. i eventually improved my ways and was able to try amazing hair care brands. i realized that what i use impacts my hair health tremendously. i am now aware of how important it is that we shower our hair with a bunch of tlc.  so from using only sulfate, paraben, silicon, and phthalate -free shampoo and conditioner, i am adding serums and elixir to my hair care must-haves!⁣
⁣
 §black_small_square§︎cbdetox de stressing scalp elixir with tea tree and 100 mg hemp oil ($56) - i used this one every time i got out of the shower. i finished this one already. i am that person whose scalp hurts after 24 hours of not washing her hair, sometimes lesser than that. i looked it up multiple times in the past and the internet told me that it is because of dirt/oil accumulating on my scalp. my scalp must be that sensitive! i think this elixir had some great effect on my scalp and hair shaft situation. it’s been awhile since the last time i felt that discomfort. i also love love love how this smells. it smells like baby powder to me. you should try this one if you’re looking for something that can protect your scalp and hair for environmental pollutants, soothes and relaxed overworked hair, relieves itchiness, flakes, hair loss, and dirt buildup. the only thing that makes me sad is that it doesn’t last a long time. i finished it quickly. ⁣
⁣
§black_small_square§︎root 66 abundance serum for fuller hair with adaptogens + sativa seed oil ($54) - who doesn’t want a fuller hair? i was super excited to try this one because i do have very flat, naturally weighed down hair, tragic i know. this serum aims to lengthen, strengthen, and promote hair growth. it also thickens hair and prevents hair loss. i am almost done with my bottle but as of now, i honestly haven’t noticed any drastic change like thicker hair and less hair fall. §down_arrow§§down_arrow§§down_arrow§

amorepacific's brand, cubeme, has a perfect cube plus, an inner beauty ampoule, so i've been having it lately. i've tried fish collagen a few times, but... i hate the fishy smell so much that i couldn’t have it. but this one tastes good because it tastes like lychee! 120mg of korean hyaluronic acid, biotin is the main ingredient, and it has 6,000mg of low-dispensing fish collagen, elastin, ceramide, and vitamin c, so it's great to be able to fill all kinds of nutrients with this ampoule! one box contains a month's worth, and it was 25ml, so it wasn't too much to eat every day :)

아모레퍼시픽의 브랜드인 큐브미에서 이너 뷰티 앰플인 퍼펙트 큐브플러스가 있어 요즘 챙겨먹고 있어요. 저는 피쉬 콜라겐을 몇 번 시도해봤지만… 그 비린 냄새가 너무 싫어서 잘 안먹는데 얘는 리치맛이라 맛있더라구요! 국내산 히알루론산 120mg, 비오틴이 주원료이고, 저분사피쉬콜라겐 6000mg과 엘라스틴, 세라마이드, 비타민c 등이 함께 있어 이 앰플 하나로 여러가지 영양을 채울 수 있어서 좋더라구요! 한 박스에는 한 달치가 들어있고, 25ml짜리라 매일 먹기에도 부담스럽지 않았어요 :)

byebye infancy, hello toddler. already? how? 

i am such an emotional wreck. i am so proud. yet, so sad. how bittersweet this all is. 

on year ago, through all these uncertainties, with the world an utter mess, we did it! and despite all of my fears, in that split second our eyes met for the very first time on april 6th, 2020, at 2:55pm, i knew it was going to be alright. 

i welcomed you to this crazy world, completely solo. papa on the ipad & not a village in sight. 
it was just you & i ... the first night, and the second & nearly your entire first year there were no extra arms to hold you, no coffee dates with friends, no baby playdates & no village to support me in this new role that is motherhood. 

our first weeks together were filled with fears, uncertainty & stress. but you know what? it has only made us stronger. 

this year i've learned that the days are long, but the years are so incredibly short! you were my quarantine buddy, my isolation companion, my best friend, ultimately! & this bond, this mother-daughter bond that you and i share, is everlasting!

baby girl, you might not be able to tell, but you are  so loved and admired. every person in our lives (near & far) has unique gifts to share with you throughout your life & you will undoubtedly have many unique gifts to impart on us as well.

this year you have taught us to cherish every moment & live in the present, to slow down the pace & take it all in, to appreciate the little things & be grateful for everything that we have. you have taught us what love is & what unconditional love truly feels like. because of you, we see the world differently. 

mama & papa love you with all their heart & are eager to jump on this new adventure with you. hello toddler years ♡.

my new favourite way to eat carrots! the sauteed garlic + maple syrup mixture creates such a delicious combination of flavours⁣⁣, and after baking/ broiling for so long, turns into this crispy crust that tastes amazing with the carrots. enjoy!

indirectly what i mean to tell you is that i know how much anger can eat up a person, how much a mother's voice could become a nightmare, and a much a sister's tears, your ringtone. 

i mean to say i know how much pain can turn a stranger into a lover, and a lover into the very thing you detest.

i mean to say that your eye wavers when you look at me, and i know it's because grief is slowly dancing it's way up your spine, i know it's because a well of spite is dug in your bowel and you are trying to contain it 

what i mean is i know how much things can change in a second, how a fun rollercoaster can turn to a death ride at the snap of one wheel.

what i mean is i know fast fast your i love you, can turn to a goodbye
  and that is why i fear.

§green_heart§𝐂𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐥𝐥𝐚 𝐀𝐬𝐢𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐚 𝐒𝐦𝐨𝐨𝐭𝐡 𝐏𝐞𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐏𝐚𝐝𝐬
these toner pads were not stripping or irritating to my skin at all. i like to use it in the morning if i just wash my face with water or in the evening to remove any residual cleanser i may not have washed off. despite being a gentle exfoliator, it hasn’t cause any sensitivity. however it does have bergamot oil so it has some scent to it and may not be great for sensitive skin types. i love it though and will continue to use it! 

§green_heart§𝐂𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐥𝐥𝐚 𝐀𝐬𝐢𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐚 𝐂𝐚𝐥𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐅𝐚𝐜𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐓𝐨𝐧𝐞𝐫
this has become one of my favorite toners of all time - it is very watery and hydrating. because it contains cica, it is also really calming as the name suggests. this is a no fuss, easy to layer toner that is suitable for all skin types. it has no scent and also contains trehalose, a new ingredient to me. trehalose is extracted from cactus and provides deep hydration with quick absorption, helping to prevent moisture from escaping our skin!

have you tried products from @thepotions_official before? i think the formulas are great and i really hope to try more.

how does easter already feel like ages ago. long week!! §see-no-evil_monkey§

so in love with this easter outfit from @lambandlion_clothing. one of the things i love about the handmade pieces is the way the products seem to last for so long. the cuffs are made so that they can be worn turned up and down and worn for that bit longer. there’s a chance it might still fit next year §crossed_fingers:light_skin_tone§

ahoy!  welcome aboard!  sailing along waikiki’s coastline was beautiful!  i highly recommend it if you’re planning a vaca here.  it’s even better if you can book it at sunrise or sunset. 

we didn’t see any whales or dolphins, but sophia was sure she saw a mermaid §mermaid§ and shaan saw a pirate ship §pirate_flag§ §face_with_tears_of_joy§

on another note, hawaii has largely kept afloat by its multi-billion dollar tourism industry. with hawaii being one of the only states to require a negative test to enter combined with people traveling a lot less, many small business have had to shut there doors for good.  i hope one day that hawaii is brought to its former glory.

does anyone else feel like they miss the candy from their childhood like these?

i was recently #gifted some pick n mix packs from @sugarsugarcandyco that resulted in bringing back memories of opening those super tattoos hoping to get the right tattoo or swapping them with my friends. or eating the fads and pretending to smoke them.

if you feel nostalgic and want to relive some of your childhood memories, @sugarsugarcandyco are doing major restock this wednesday at 8pm. so don't forget to set your alarms!

please tell me you sang that! 

apologies for the silence the last couple of days! it’s been a bit busy here... 

i’ve taken delivery of a new overlocker which is quite simply the best purchase we’ve made for a while (i’ll pop some demos of it sewing your beautiful items into the stories later). 

three of our four new fabrics have arrived at alecia’s and honestly... we are so so excited to get them sewn up and launched so watch this space for them later this week! 

the watercolour floral fabric we have been told will be with us this week now and i’m so so excited to get that sewn up too! 

on another note... how cute are these space sweaters? 

have a lovely sunday all xx

does anyone else get a random urge to start something at a ridiculous hour? this was me friday night when i decided to scrub and clean all the grouting in between the tiles in the kitchen at 9:30pm. this then led to a full blown kitchen blitz §rolling_on_the_floor_laughing§. 

back to work tomorrow after two lovely weeks off. if you’re returning as your line of work is reopening, i hope it all goes well for you!

§white_heart§rapid review§white_heart§
•light watery toner, absorbs pretty quickly
•has a soothing affect and quite hydrating
•great for all skin types, but may not be enough for very dry types

§memo§thoughts§memo§
this toner is very lightweight, great for layering. as for its ability to hydrate the skin, it does quite well. it’s hydration is not outstanding, but adequate for my dehydrated skin. i think the hydration from this toner would be perfect for those with normal to oilier skin types.
it’s also quite soothing as well. i used this after wearing a mask at work when i developed some irritated bumps. after a few days, the bumps were gone and my skin, happy §smiling_face§

§memo§thoughts§memo§ 
this cream was nowhere near enough for my dehydrated skin. my face felt so parched and tight after using this. it’s not hydrating enough, neither moisturizing enough. 
i gave this to my friend instead and they enjoyed it. it was perfectly enough for their combo-oily skin and it had a soothing effect.

§memo§thoughts§memo§
this was a rather good exfoliator. i use this after cleansing, although some choose to use it before cleansing. it isn’t rough at all, and the exfoliation is very gentle. after washing this off, my face felt much softer. the only con i can think of is that i find the citrus scent a bit funky.

a thing i’ve come to understand in the last few days....i don’t need a single person in my life...and that’s not to be harsh to the people i love at all. i want every single person that i let in to be there. every person i have fought to remain a part of my life is not because i cannot live without them, it’s simply because i enjoy them and their company and i want them to be around..and i think that shows huge growth and a step in the right direction to rediscovering my independence with my mental health journey §woman_shrugging§

the plastic wraps may still be on the units but we are really cooking on gas now (can you tell it’s sunday and i’m excited for my weekly line of duty fix?)
the flooring gets done this week - another step closer to being finished! for now - here’s some monochrome love (with added green smoke because i just can’t help myself) - in this house green is a neutral! feeling like a proper grown up for once to be getting a new kitchen we’ve picked rather than just inherited with a house - definite life goals right there! 

it was so nice to chat to people on the @wherewehome saturday sesh last night - have found some lush accounts i wasn’t following so will do a little sunday share later.

can you believe i struggled with my post again today... stupidly i looked ahead at the prompts and when i saw black and white i thought, well that's practically my whole house so i'll have loads to take a photo of... which is true but i'm in one and wasn't happy with a single photo, until this one.

i don't think i've shown this full angle before... looking into our living room from the kitchen area but i think it does a good job at showing just how much black and white (well the paint is dulux timeless) there is in our home.

shockingly i wasn't drunk last night. we let emily have a danger nap at about 5 and did not fancy being up all night with her while battling off a hangover.

to be honest i prefer drunk me... drunk me probably wouldn't have taken an hour to decide on today's photo but don't worry if i'm struggling with tomorrow's prompt i'll get some sauvignon out, purely for artistic inspiration you understand.

posting more of the same rooms again. i'm so behind on our diy at the moment as life is just so busy. hopefully our sofas are arriving this week and it will give me that final push to actually decorate the room. no promises though.

‘dinosaurs are for boys’ has been an immy catchphrase around here lately. i have no idea where this little misconception has come from! §woman_tipping_hand:light_skin_tone§

so today i set up this dinosaur themed small world to hopefully change immy’s mind! i think the dinosaur cuddle at the end says it all! §sauropod§ §red_heart§§t-rex§ 

how amazing is this volcano story scene piece from @forevertoyshop

we have some great news!! we finally have a builder starting work on our bedroom and en-suite a week tomorrow §party_popper§

those that have been following for a while will know i’ve been banging on about starting these rooms for ages. we’ve done as much as we can do ourselves including knocking out walls etc but it’s been a nightmare getting any tradesman in. they’re all stacked out with work so either been turning down the job or there’s been long delays in getting started. this seems to be the thing everywhere at the moment so i’m sure plenty of you will have felt the pain on this too!

anyway, it’s on. it’s happening! we’ve got pipework to replace, a 4m beam to go in, new electrics, sockets, switches and radiators to be fitted, and a window to be blocked up (don’t worry, it’s just moving further over). so nothing pretty to see for a while but they’re big jobs that will allow us to then be able to carry on with renovating these rooms. 

you may remember ages ago i did a poll asking everyone whether they thought we should go for black or brass in the en-suite? well, the poll said black and i went with that for a while but in the end, i decided i just wasn’t happy with it and we went for brass instead (sorry guys!).

all of that has now arrived, as well as the tiles, the lusso vanity is on order and due to arrive early june (yes it will still probably be that long until it’s all done!) and the bed is on order too. 

oh and to top off the great news, we finally confirmed our new windows order this week §bottle_with_popping_cork§ - that’s been bloody painful!

but it’s all slowly moving forward now! catch me in about 2-3months when our house will hopefully be looking very different §star-struck§

happy sunday! the day of nothing..
we had a great day yesterday at balmedie beach in the sunshine, gale force winds and then hailstones.. jeez! we came home  feeling defeated by the elements.

the entrance hallway is one of the first areas i want to complete. i have temporarily put our old ikea mirror here but its not actually tall enough for the space. ideally i would like either a thin black framed mirror or one with no frame at all. i have a console table in mind but whether its still available next month is another story.

shoe storage was going to be the next purchase for in here but in all honesty, i just dont want our shoes to be here. its unsightly and storage is chunky so that will be stored outside the front door of the flat instead.

i will do a walk through of this space, as is, at some point this week.

have a gorgeous day!

there's is something about water - about the oceans and the seas, about how they are unapologetically free. 

there's something about her calm and her strength and how the waves claim land territory as hers.

water is everything i wish to be calm, bold, passionate and free.

there's something about the water that reminds me to breathe, to be free, to be me

. . . one thing i have definitely neglected whilst working out at home has been my glute activation!!!

activation isn't about fatiguing the muscles pre-workout, it's about waking the muscles up and getting the blood flowing so that you get the most from your session.

i tend to do 3 or 4 of the following activation exercises as art of my warm-up before lower body workouts;

istanbul is a melting pot of a city influenced by a diverse set of cultures over thousands of years. the history tracks from byzantium to constantinople building the most powerful legacy of the ottoman empire.

it is a city where one minute you are walking where crusaders once marched; stepping into mosques that are the epitome of islamic  architecture; then peeking into the sultan's harem; & then bargaining for the best prices in the spice bazaar.  aside from the complex history, the food alone will transform your taste buds around the spine of the bosphorus showing the relationship between europe and asia.

how beautiful was last nights sky §revolving_hearts§

it’s very rare i have a saturday off & the weather was just gorgeous yesterday.  our day pretty much involved gardening & a walk round the river.....ending with a few drinks & chill.  bliss! (man i feel old.....but i’m kinda getting used to there not being much else to do now§woman_shrugging:light_skin_tone§) 

i had a vision of how i wanted the low planters to look and it’s starting to get there....come summer they should look perfect when it all starts to grow and flower §crossed_fingers:light_skin_tone§

i wrote a poem §dove§

we are beings constantly seeking pleasure,
when within us we hold the greatest treasure.

with god by our side,
its time to move, stride by stride,

what is life without risk?
simply an opportunity, missed.

go deep beyond what it means to live,
to experience this world and what you have to give.

for the moment we give up on hope,
that’s when we feel we cannot cope.

don’t spend too long figuring it all out,
as before you know it you’re greeted with doubt.

it is time to reconnect with your burning desire.

after all, what is life without risk?
simply an opportunity, missed.

wishing you all the most beautiful sunday §white_heart§

§green_heart§ sunday talk with @skinglow.armi §green_heart§
・・・
it has been such a winter weather today in rome §cloud_with_rain§
and winter makes me use all sort of products to reach soft, hydrated skin and oils help in this process §smiling_face_with_hearts§
deage detox oil has a nutrient blend of oils that help replenish skin and give glow to your cheeks§sparkles§

i use it instead of a serum, to add hydration. a tiny drop is enough for the entire face§winking_face§
i use it on my body also, after taking a shower to help smooth my skin and for a spa- like mood§woman_getting_massage:light_skin_tone§

i think this period is perfect for incorporating oils§cherry_blossom§
what do you use mostly in colder weather? §snowflake§

lani is doing really well with solids. i’m glad i started when i did. she’s always watching me eat and gets so cranky when i don’t give her any§face_with_tears_of_joy§
she only gets a small amount and we don’t do it every day either. it’s been more of a fun activity but next week when she turns 5 months (i’m not crying you are§crying_face§) we will be deep into making solids a part of our daily routine! 

at what age did you make solids a part of your daily routine?
