if you've been following this series you'll have perhaps noticed that the toll for children in the past year has been immense, but crucially, the most vulnerable children in our society the one's who have already been let down many, many times are faring worst of all. it is shocking, but if you've been paying attention for the last 11 years, not remotely surprising. if you've learnt something new or enjoyed the right word?

happy monday! back to today. they're both still fast asleep in bed so i'm enjoying a quite cuppa and catching up on a bit of news. here's to a fabulous new week this... i feel like i'm so unsettled with my page of late...some days i'm in a happy place of posting what i want and writing what i want...then i see other accounts with great engagement, who i myself feel engaged with, and think i ought to be more like them, have pretty tidy grids more like them, be more carefree posting like them... but i'm me, and as much as this account is my 'blogging' account, it's still so much just me, and maybe that's ok @itsgise iᴛ’s ᴍᴏɴᴅᴀʏ. iᴛ’s ɴᴏᴛ ʙᴀᴅ. iᴛ’s ᴊᴜsᴛ ᴡʜᴀᴛ ʏᴏᴜ ᴍᴀᴋᴇ ᴏғ ɪᴛ. ᴜɴʙᴇᴢᴀʜʟᴛᴇ ᴡᴇʀʙᴜɴɢ ᴍᴀʀᴋᴇɴɴᴇɴɴᴜɴɢ ᴋᴇɪɴᴇ ᴋᴏᴏᴘᴇʀᴀᴛɪᴏɴ e s t h e t i c s learning to show up as me we can filter what we want! i love a filter learning to show up without a filter isn’t easy but i don’t want to only show up when i’m insta worthy or with a filter i want to show up unapologetically me. i want to feel beautiful even when that inner voice is saying that pictures not good enough! ban the ideology of perfect. you are perfect just the way you are i love these photos too much not to share them to the grid. the birthday celebrations are over. with lockdown there wasn't a great deal we could do to celebrate dave's 30th but i tried and i think succeeded to make it as lovely as i could for him. we spent the evening doing an online escape room from @thepanicroomgravesend which was absolutely brilliant!!! we played along with his mum and dad and had a great evening!! really recommend as a lockdown activity for date night or a birthday etc. the 30 presents for 30 years was a massive hit too and something i loved doing along with the help of amelia. now can we be out of lockdown in time for my birthday in april please boris? i had a lockdown birthday last year! oh hey spring, is that you we see lurking around the corner? sunglasses: @ebayuk shirt: vintage bloomers: @winniewoouk personalised and custom cards available from $6.95pp gift tags card packs send directly to the recipient option wholesale available stockists welcome simply send us a dm if you are after anything in particular and i would be more than happy to assist may xx proud outfit repeater⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ this udderly gorgeous incense holder is now featured on my etsy shop! find the link to my etsy in my bio! injecting some spring into my wardrobe bodysuit: @zara jeans: @stradivarius boots bag: @zara this palette shocks me every time how can it be so versatile i love working with it this palette shocks me every time how can it be so versatile i love working with it this is just a friendly reminder to leave the gun and take the cannoli. well, the cannolo in this case! recipe linked in my bio for a limited time! the face you pull when you realise homeschooling starts again today! hope everyone had a nice half-term and that boris delivers us all some positive news today back to the grind. haven’t shown off this space for a hot minute. i see all these glam study rooms people have created since working from home and i’m not gonna lie it makes me a bit jel. this tiny set up is in the corner of our bedroom for my 6ft partner to work at everyday just keeping it real you know when the hairdresser does your hair perfectly, looking amazing but then you quickly learn that replicating it everyday is a mission... honestly, i’m struggling to make this hair cut look decent everyday, and have kind of had to accept that i just need to embrace the “messy vibe” it’s definitely freeing, light still feels amazing, plus i’m saving so much money on conditioner haha. do you prefer short or long hair do you invest in product photography or do you diy it? our longest standing client is @bechunky. we've been with these guys since the beginning of our business journey and theirs too! it's been so cool to watch them evolve and i love working with a company that's so forward thinking. i've photographed their bottles and cups pretty much across the world now! hope you all have a great start to the week this bodysuit is so comfy i love wearing it, it was long enough at the bottom its a new week, that means new chances and new choices. if something is costing your peace, your sense of self and being then its not for you. whether its a relationship, a job, a person, a thought. don't sacrifice yourself, just because and then call it a compromise. there's a difference. you're far too valuable to just be mediocre and unsatisfied. have a great week all follow @nurseangiejay follow @nurseangiejay comment, like, share anyone else nervous about borris’ announcement later? we get married in august so feeling anxious about what he’s going to say. hopefully we get some clarity but on a positive we’re another week down and spring is on it’s way our next panelling project is this room, we want to panel 23 of the wall! trying to talk ben into it sooner rather then later have a lovely day pretty in pink can you spot our newest colour? 𝐒𝐌𝐎𝐊𝐄 𝐃𝐀𝐃𝐃𝐈𝐄𝐒 𝐁𝐀𝐋𝐇𝐀𝐌 this isn’t your average takeaway, this is @thesmokedaddies takeaway! their menu is a 𝐁𝐄𝐋𝐓𝐄𝐑 serving insane burgers, hot dogs, tacos amongst other things it was so tough to pick and with a motto after my own heart smoke.meat.eat.repeat it’s safe to say i knew their food was going to be a knock-out. 𝐎𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞: bone to pick wagyu patty in a brioche bun, sausome their original sauce beef bacon, hash round with a 𝐛𝐞𝐞𝐟 𝐬𝐡𝐨𝐫𝐭 𝐫𝐢𝐛. remove the bone before biting! risk it for a brisket 14 hour smoked brisket burger with pickles and slaw again, melt in your mouth meat. pulled lamb sandwich smoked, tender lamb marinated in pomegranate molasses, ras el hanout spices and served with cucumber. this was also a standout for me. remember to 𝐒𝐀𝐕𝐄 𝐒𝐇𝐀𝐑𝐄 for your lockdown list. eat.snack.repeat. happy monday! starting off the week with a zara thread styling this jacket and skort set. which style to you prefer 1,2,3,4,5,6 or 7? this will all be tagged in my @21buttonsuk link via my bio breakfast strawberry and raspberry pastry rolls, with a side of greek yoghurt with chia seeds and raspberries, strawberry and pears. he had quite the selection today and he loved it for the pastry rolls: i mixed cream cheese with mashed raspberries and strawberries, spread a layer on the pastry and then rolled them like a mini pinwheel. i milk washed before cooking in the over for 10mins at 200. i had to leave them for a good few minutes to cook before serving. i’ve thrown some into the freezer also for another day this is my face today because online classes started again and i come directly from my 7 days night shifts it makes my heart so happy to see how much this cutie loves to be outside. when the breezewind blows in her face she flutters her eyelashes with a huge smile on her face. this in itself makes my heart jump. yesterday felt like spring, for the first time. the warmth of the sun on our faces was the nicest feeling. it was a day filled with hope and laughter and all those yummy feels. she was dancing while i took these pictures. and i’m hoping that despite them being stills you can tell porche 911 mario bellini's sofas are the perfect breathtaking mix. @deform.space obviously this isn’t the sky we’re greeted with today but, maybe surprisingly, this isn’t a summer throwback but a november one! i love crow point and the sense of space you get walking there, no matter the time of day or year. the dunes are incredible as are the views once you’ve managed to clamber up them! do you think you could make it up without stopping? hi everyone, today is a post about something we often tend to neglect. some of us can do without it. while some suffer from serious problems but are unable to get help as this is a less spoken topic! i hope with my post i’m able to help many. tried my best to list down product recommendations as well. please share this post and help maximum of your friends with love, pragya monday mornings if you can't stay in bed, dress like you're still wearing the duvet happy monday guys you know what that means don’t you its the first day of the school...... oh shit i forgot there still at home. is anyone else eagerly awaiting what boris has to say? mum’s pour yourself a coffee, take a deep breath. we’ve got this wax melts from the lovely @thewaxquarter monday and like that half term was over! i am so not mentally prepared for work today and the monday morning struggle to get up is in full force. but, once i actually drag my arse out of bed and have my morning tea, i’ve got this! don’t forget to take a look at my giveaway. if you’re anything like me i screenshot or save so many things to go back and do later.... so if that’s you too don’t forget to find the post and enter pretty please happy ft. @fentyskin ‘s skincare set today’s post is not a review rather i’m sharing my favourite quote of the day move out of your comfort zone. you can only grow if you are willing to feel awkward and uncomfortable when you try something new. -brian tracy not related to the quote, but i want to share that i am on a creative rut hehe. if you’ve seen and followed my page, you can tell that it is so messy. my adrenaline is rushing to somehow fixed it and now i wanted a bit of a scheme to it, i will also change my review structure, hehe what do you think about the quote? ...and are you on creative rut as well? if so,how’s it going? spread love, kirsten i am a huge @dermalogicaaus fan and have used their skincare for years. these are probably my 2 favourites although i use others too daily: precleanse this deep cleansing oil thoroughly melts away layers of excess sebum oil, sunscreen, waterproof make-up, environmental pollutants and residual products that build up on skin throughout the day and block pores. it contains conditioning essential fatty acids that nourish skin and enables your cleanser to work more efficiently. microfoliant a rice-based powder that activates upon contact with water, releasing papain, salicylic acid and rice enzymes to polish skin to perfection. it removes dulling surface debris and evens skin tone to reveal brighter, smoother skin. gentle enough for daily use happy monday i’m so happy the bedroom is now painted i could bloody scream! i actually spend more time in here now than in the living room however the blank walls are starting to drive me a little nuts so after work we’ve said to look for some wall art of some form to try and blend it a little! we have so much going on this week and our front garden is finally going to be finished, we’re having new slabs for the entrance of the house and artificial grass laid! i don’t know why but new build grass tends to look so shit, but i’m over it and it’s coming out, mixed with wfh and two sausage dogs... is it wine time yet? @sunsetontheearth how gorgeous is this mandala print from the angel shona over @sunsetontheearth cant wait to frame and put this up grab your orders with a generous 15 off with my code: ash15 my feed is slowly being taken over by mirrors, so yes i’m obsessed i hope everyone had a lovely weekend! i wanted to take a few days off instagram but hoping to get back to it this week even though i took no new pictures this weekend so digging through some extras i’ve found i spent the whole weekend cleaning and doing countless loads of washing the joys of a lockdown weekend but i did put new feet on my fb marketplace chair but yet to find some fabric to cover it does the list of things to do ever get smaller have a great monday! happy monday! we bought some daffodils last week and they really brighten up the room! have a great day guys! creamy mushroom pasta.. there’s so many dairy free alternatives now for cheese you can really create a creamy sauce without using any animal products! another was to create a creamy sauce is to soak cashews in boiling water and blend them with a stock cube, some garlic and salt and pepper! check out my igtv to make this recipe yourself start your week as strong as your coffee although i take a sugar free vanilla, almond milk latte. you? so there's a lot of discourse around not giving in to the obligation to exercisebe smaller bodied fit the beauty standard, but much like ed recovery in general, fixing associations in your brain often comes through rigid rules and structure before you can reach the place of intuitive eatingintuitive movement. by giving myself these rules and emphatically not allowing myself exercise when i broke them i slowly got rid of the addiction and was able to find what about exercise i actually liked and what parts of it were just things i thought i should like. it's enhanced my training now because rather than trying to be good at things that i was only doing for the wrong reasons, now i have a genuine grin on my face even if i stop a session mid way or don't hit a pb...it means that rather than my life and mood depending on exercise, exercise now depends on my life and my mood, so tonight when boris lets us know how we're getting out of lockdown, there will be no planning maximum utility of gym time, it will fit into my schedule if it does, if it doesn't, that's cool too lime lines happy monday you guys a brand new week to shine and grow! this piece is a bit more abstract but i’m a sucker for a colour gradient 𝙳𝙰𝚈 𝚃𝚆𝙴𝙽𝚃𝚈 𝚃𝚆𝙾: 𝙼𝚈 𝙷𝙰𝙿𝙿𝚈 𝙿𝙻𝙰𝙲𝙴 prompt for @thatmamaclub my happy place is llandudno there’s something about that place that just makes me feel totally happy and relaxed. there’s so much to do there, the scenery is beautiful and it’s where alice in wonderland was inspired from. this is one of the first places we will go when lockdown is over! i can’t wait to walk along the beach, have ice cream at through the looking glass and search for all the statues again where’s your happy place? question: is this too much check print? further to my pressing matters feature very much a recommended read even though i possibly am a tad bias. i have even more exciting news, a rebranded website. my rebranded website is now live which is created with you in mind. if you could take 5 minutes of your day to help a small business and read through the website, that would be brilliant. the link is in the bio, i am excited to see what path it will lead me down and the new connections i will form. i am still expanding my photography portfolio and would love help from you to do that. would you be happy to help? i want to give thanks to @yorecollective and the help she gave! such a wholesome, happy person who did not have to help me with this project. i’ve been wanting to work on something slightly different to my usual stuff and i can not wait to push myself, learn something new and create work that i normally drool over. this leads me to a small discussion what makes good branding? well after studying it for a tiny bit, i hope my knowledge can help someone who reads this. i believe design, branding and creativity cannot be right nor wrong, so just have fun. right, let’s get started. once you’ve developed your brand identity and applied it to a multitude of assets, don’t forget about your website. your online attendance is your face on the internet, and it should reflect your brand identity equally in design and content. when it comes to branding typography plays a big part in precisely where your vision leads. communicating who and what brand you represent. serif, sans serif, or script sans serif fonts will communicate a modern, minimalistic feel while serif can appear old school. with most foundations in art or design, designers guide picking 2-3 complimentary fonts within the same typeface and subsequently, you can stay consistent across all your assets. like every respectable product or service, every brand starts with a brand strategy to solidify the “why” behind your brand, ask yourself a few helpful interrogations, and begin to speak your company’s mission. here are just a few tips there is plenty more to share but what do you think creates good branding?

at least the weather was nice, so i got to get out for a walk in the woods near my home, and it was lovely to see that it’s full of snowdrops! i love the simple elegance of snowdrops, but also, they are a sign to me that spring is on its way. have a wonderful monday lovelies! s n e a k p e e k so a very productive weekend but still some snags to do on the bathroom so i’m hoping won’t be too long. but for now here is a sneak peek of what is probably the only tidy corner of my house. i have to put the laundry away today as we are all living out of laundry baskets but i just can’t bring myself to do it. i did all the washing last week but just didn’t have time to put it all away and now it’s like a huge mountain casting a shadow over me anyone else just hate that part of doing the washing?! decorative baskets @bmstores happy monday everyone today they weather is not as nice today as it was yesterday. as it was such a nice day it inspired me to do a reel on neutral colours. check out my stories for some more neutral styling. hope you like it i love these shoes i found in the zara sale earlier this year. i think these are something i will keep and wear for years. first home bedroom... will miss having an actual bedroom for a year! we will have a room but will be multipurpose not just a bedroom... we have our bedroom currently without a tv etc just for sleeping! cannot wait for our new master suite! happy monday all. starting the week how i wish it to continue, well dressed and put together. let’s see how long this lasts. shirt @withnothingunderneath shorts @countryroad shoes @chloe look at me pushing myself out of my comfort zone! i don’t normally wear bright colours so this purple crew neck was a weird thing for me to buy, but i just really loved the colour and couldn’t resist! remains to be seen whether i’ll be brave enough to actually wear it out though... back in time this weekend was warmer and sunny and gave me hope that spring is on its way! what about you? are you experiencing a taste of the change of seasons yet? i love that i left the house with just this lovely jacket form @theseamstressofbloomsbury hope your week is off to a great start! and breaaaathe… a couple of weeks away from instagram, and all social media actually, has been so needed. sometimes it can become all too easy to fall into the pit of comparison that insta often comes hand in hand with. whether that be comparing how good you think someone’s life is against yours, or comparing how ‘successful’ someone’s account seems to be in comparison to yours. but the reality is, none of that matters against what is going on in your real life, and taking time away from social media was what i needed to remind myself of that. whilst you feel like you can really see how good someone’s life is, realistically you are seeing a tiny percentage you can’t see their feelings. i started this account because i wanted to be able to post freely about something i love and not feel like people who knew me were watching and judging. the idea of it just being a hobby was something i was losing sight of amongst the muddle of yet another lockdown and being a 22 year old who doesn’t have a clue what she wants to do. various feelings of pressure, anxiety and guilt were just tiring me out every day, and then i had an epiphany ‘i can just delete instagram’. the world doesn’t stop turning if you don’t go on social media for a few weeks…mad right?! anyway now i am back with a clearer head on my shoulders and my notifications firmly turned off hope everyone is doing okay! let me know what you’ve been up to recently in the comments below why you should pat dry your skin! rubbing your skin with a harsh, textured towel can cause irritation and inflammation. if you can, pat dry your skin with your hands. if not, use a very soft face cloth or bath towel and gently pat your skin. do not drag or rub the skin. this can worsen redness, disrupt acne or stretch the skin. ​here's some more tips: wash your bath towels at least once a week wash your face cloths every 2-3 days avoid leaving your face cloths to dry in the shower, as this encourages the growth of bacteria my fur babies my fur babies lipofirm pro is a revolutionary treatment that uses heat energy to destroy fat cells and tighten the skin around the treatment area. it's credited as one of the best high-performance aesthetic devices in europe to treat mummy tummy skin without surgery. monday?

before friday, my last girls night out was... oh gosh i can’t even remember? months and months ago. it usually takes a lot of scheduling and organisation to get a group of mums together.. right? sometimes it kinda seems like it might just be easier to book it in for sometime in 20 years. but when the stars align and it all comes together and it all works in your favour; oh god you can’t get much better than a good night out where someone else cooks you dinner, brings you drinks and does the dishes! and you can have conversations that are best left for when there isn’t little ears listening in sitting back, no one to look after and a tiny handbag on my lap, a drink in my hand and laughing and laughing with the girls was exactly what i needed and i just hope it isn’t as long before the next time i get to let my hair down! do you find it takes a lot of manifesting and organisation to get you and the girls together? what’s your favourite thing about a night out with the gals? good morning! today’s the day boris tells us the plan. i wonder how much longer i’ll be wearing my joggers and sitting at home having cuddles with poppy for?! i’m not complaining, it’s a privilege compared to other people and i love cuddles with poppy, but i cannot wait to get some structure back in my life. it’s so hard not having a purpose for every day, instead i’m just filling the gaps. i’m sending lots of love out to all of you today, no matter what circumstance you’re in. there’s a light at the end of the tunnel the first shot in this series is the only shot i managed to get on my own before poppy came and plonked herself on me. so swipe to see how it went why choose @motherchildmethod?

it’s cold and wet, and i wanna snuggle 186 day one! my monochrome look was always going to black wasn’t it? @chloekoyce i’ve been thinking a lot recently about the fitness industry and how much i think it’s changed. i started getting into fitness when i was 1415 with the only goal of losing weight, getting abs and having a thigh gap. i was so young but this was something that was drilled into my mind. i thought these were the things needed to be accepted by others. i never needed to lose weight, i remember people saying i looked quite athletic but i didn’t see it, i was constantly comparing to other girls in my year, the popular ones who i thought had it all. comparing to my best friend. just feeling that i wasn’t good enough because i didn’t think i looked like everyone else. this sparked my eating disorder and things only got worse. endless cardio. running everyday, doing ‘burn inner thigh’ and ‘flat stomach’ workouts everyday, often in secret. just because this was what i was being fed by society. i got the thigh gap, was i happy? no, i was severely underweight, malnourished and had lost my period. all in the name of ‘fitness’ it’s been a long time but i can finally say that i don’t want to achieve these things. it’s not in my genetics to have these things without being a dangerously low weight and having dangerously low body fat. i want strong, powerful legs that can lift heavy weights and get me from place to place without feeling tired! i want my quads to be poppingggg i truly think that there are enough people in this industry now who are promoting such positive messages that we have moved away from the thigh gal era! now, i’m seeing so many more people spread the message of: training for enjoyment, empowerment and to feel strong letting others know that what you see isn’t gospel showing that our bodies are meant to move, jiggle and wobble showing that no foods are off limits and everything has it’s place that lifting weights doesn’t make you look bulky fitness doesn’t have a look. it’s not trying to shrink yourself to be the smallest person possible. let’s stop seeing it as such an aesthetic driven thing! i’ve tagged some incredible, inspiring role models for just promoting feeling damn good in the body you’re in winging it as always i’m winging it. who isn’t! i’ve got it all crossed for a glimmer of good news from boris today..... jumper by @selfishmother another beautiful dress, i paired this dress with my primary black loafers and this stunning black @kateandpippa black hooded coat another beautiful dress, i paired this dress with my primary black loafers and this stunning black @kateandpippa black hooded coat monday morning and just like that back to reality! i’ve had such a nice week off for half term and now it’s back to remote learning! what’s everyone’s plans for the week? today's is inspired by the big yellow thing in the sky that's decided to make an appearance! how are you all doing? first day back to homeschooling, i wasn't looking forward to it after a lovely week off, but hopefully bojo will give us the news we've all been waiting for this evening! mandala pieces coloured rings @joguinesgrapat lowercase letters @reelwooddesign natural ring discs @tickiteducation family read kids bathroom this bathroom is a pretty big space, so i’m finding lots of little pretty things to fill it up! starting with these shelves from ebay! i saw them on an insta lovelies page a couple of weeks agoso sorry completely forgot who and thought they were perfect! filled them up with some of my ikea candle haul and some ms faux greenery! next...on its way some prints for the wall! family read kids bathroom this bathroom is a pretty big space, so i’m finding lots of little pretty things to fill it up! starting with these shelves from ebay! i saw them on an insta lovelies page a couple of weeks agoso sorry completely forgot who and thought they were perfect! filled them up with some of my ikea candle haul and some ms faux greenery! next...on its way some prints for the wall! 1k just woke up to 1000 of you beautiful people, thank you so much. this little project has been keeping me sane over the last month next month i’ll have been furloughed for a year! and i appreciate every single one of your support virtual hugs pretty dress! this is the 14 but a bit big and no 12 to try. i wouldn’t have anywhere to wear it anyway praying crop top season will be upon us again soon! and it’s monday again already. new week, new goals, new announcement. wonder what we’ll find out on today’s episode of bojo. feeling much more refreshed after a self care sunday. my hair feels so soft and smells gorgeous after using the philip kingsley elastizer! have a lovely week everyone les fleurs hivernales ils ont de très belles fleurs the best way to cheer yourself is to try to cheer someone else up the power of wife february feel like spring 17 hi ho, hi ho here i am showing what the handmade, hand-embroidered seven dwarves shirt looks like on a real hooman. it's just the coolest piece, and so well made. the cotton is a quality medium-weight no flimsiness! and the gingham collar and cuffs and embroidered detail are just so special! tap the link in my bio to shop this truly unique vintage piece worldwide shipping available the shipping rate includes tracked express shipping through @anpostofficial m o n d a y good morning everyone! hope we are all doing good i have had zero energy to keep posting on insta recently. but i am so looking forward to the full moon coming up this week time to release all that negative energy and things that no longer serve you who feels ready for that!?

blue monday creator is the lovely @ailsah.cleans chicken pasta bake if you’re looking for a simple meal prep idea this will be perfect! save for later and don’t forget to share ingredients chicken or any other protein substitute pasta peppers red onion garlic ginger seasoning anything you like tomato based pasta sauce in a pan, sauté the garlic, ginger and onions. add the chicken and cook until it’s golden brown, add the tomato sauce and let it simmer. in another saucepan cook the pasta as instructed on the package. once the pasta is done add it all to the same pan until everything is coated evenly! put it in an oven proof dish add some cheese at this point if you like and cook for 20-25mins at 190 degrees and enjoy yin yang with a caribbean twist... whenever i take these abstract coastal shots i can't help but think about the duality of life.. i think about the good the bad, safety danger, security adventure and even, life death. but then again one wouldn't have meaning without the other...right? blondes have more fun ha... so do gingers happy monday let’s try and be empty of worrying and if we do, think of who created the thought note to self 𝘙𝘪𝘤𝘦 𝘊𝘰𝘯𝘨𝘦𝘦 ข้าวต้ม ᴀ ꜱᴛᴀᴘʟᴇ ᴀɴᴅ ꜱɪᴍᴘʟᴇ ʙʀᴇᴀᴋꜰᴀꜱᴛ ᴏᴘᴛɪᴏɴ ᴛʜᴀᴛ ᴄᴀɴ ʙᴇ ᴇɴᴊᴏʏᴇᴅ ᴀᴛ ᴀɴʏᴛɪᴍᴇ ᴏꜰ ᴅᴀʏ. ʟɪᴋᴇ ᴍᴏꜱᴛ ᴀꜱɪᴀɴ ᴄᴜʟᴛᴜʀᴇꜱ, ɪɴ ᴛʜᴀɪʟᴀɴᴅ ᴡᴇ ᴅᴏɴ'ᴛ ʜᴀᴠᴇ ꜱᴇᴛ ʙʀᴇᴀᴋꜰᴀꜱᴛ ᴇᴀᴛꜱ ʜᴏᴡᴇᴠᴇʀ, ᴛʜɪꜱ ɪꜱ ᴅᴇꜰɪɴɪᴛᴇʟʏ ᴀ ᴘᴏᴘᴜʟᴀʀ ᴏᴘᴛɪᴏɴ. ᴜꜱᴜᴀʟʟʏ ꜱᴇʀᴠᴇᴅ ᴡɪᴛʜ ᴇxᴘʟᴏꜱɪᴠᴇ ꜱɪᴅᴇꜱ ᴛᴏ ᴊᴀᴢᴢ ᴜᴘ ᴛʜᴇ ꜱɪᴍᴘʟᴇ ꜰʟᴀᴠᴏᴜʀꜱ ɪɴ ʀɪᴄᴇ ᴄᴏɴɢᴇᴇ ᴏʀ ɪᴛ ᴄᴀɴ ʙᴇ ᴇɴᴊᴏʏᴇᴅ ᴏɴ ɪᴛꜱ ᴏᴡɴ. ʜᴇʀᴇ, ɪ'ᴠᴇ ᴄᴏᴜᴘʟᴇᴅ ᴍɪɴᴇ ᴡɪᴛʜ ᴀ ꜱᴀʟᴛʏ ᴅᴜᴄᴋ ᴇɢɢ, ꜰʀɪᴇᴅ ɢᴀʀʟɪᴄ, ᴄʀɪꜱᴘʏ ᴏɴɪᴏɴꜱ, ᴄʜɪʟʟɪ, ᴡʜɪᴛᴇ ᴘᴇᴘᴘᴇʀ, ꜱʜᴀʟʟᴏᴛꜱ ᴀɴᴅ ꜱᴘʀɪɴɢ ᴏɴɪᴏɴꜱ. ᴄᴏᴍᴍᴇɴᴛ ʙᴇʟᴏᴡ ᴀɴᴅ ʟᴇᴛ ᴍᴇ ᴋɴᴏᴡ ᴡʜᴀᴛ ʏᴏᴜʀ ꜰᴀᴠᴏᴜʀɪᴛᴇ ᴀꜱɪᴀɴ ᴅɪꜱʜᴇꜱ ᴀʀᴇ. seeing as it’s london fashion week let’s cover some colour trends for 2021; spring colours: denim summer colours: denim autumn colours: denim winter colours: denim and whilst we’re at it our borg lined denim jacket is the most amazing quality and so versatile! tap to grab one now for only £30 𝐺𝑂𝑂𝐷 𝑀𝑂𝑅𝑁𝐼𝑁𝐺! reminder that good times are on their way home inspo sporty pinktastic 𝐌𝐚𝐤𝐞 𝐦𝐚𝐠𝐢𝐜 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐞 𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐚𝐭 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐜𝐡𝐜𝐫𝐚𝐟𝐭 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐰𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐫𝐝𝐫𝐲 𝐜𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐥𝐞 “jeff and emma have been hard at work building this insane castle.it remind us of hogwarts so we've been rewatching all the harry potter movies as a family too! @misskendrix a n n o u n c e m e n t let’s hope we are going to receive some good news later when boris does his speech we are all ready for some positive news as we head into spring. i’m keeping everything crossed a n n o u n c e m e n t let’s hope we are going to receive some good news later when boris does his speech we are all ready for some positive news as we head into spring. i’m keeping everything crossed i was asked to make this bespoke bunny with a painted bow and it looks brilliant... nice little pop of blue to this kinder bunny steak is always my favorite what's your favorite food?

keep reading save this post some mornings i wake up feeling positive. and then there are others where i get an instant hot flush of panic and overwhelm by automatic negative thinking. let me start by saying this is completely normal. even naturally, positive people experience ups and downs. what makes them naturally positive is how they bounce back from negative, overwhelming feelings and get back on track to their more optimistic ways of thinking. so here are 5 reminders to help you bounce back from anxiety in the morning: you are not your thoughts a lot of these automatic thoughts are lying to you⁣ negative thinking hurts no one but you you always have the power to choose to focus more on the positive than on the negative you are more susceptible to overwhelming negative thinking when you wake up, so consciously put effort into more positive thinking first thing in the morning⁣ anxiety and stress is only ever temporary⁣ if you really want to see a change in the way you think, work through the thought figure out the origin of the thought is it true? analyse why you had the thought in the first place how do you feel when you believe the thought? how would you feel without the thought? then take the original thought and turn it into the opposite think of one or two examples⁣ keep in mind, your brain will want to retaliate and stay in its comfort zone of familiarity of being negative in fact, it’s easier for your mind if it is conditioned to have this response, but the key to being more naturally positive is to keep reinforcing positive thinking despite how difficult it can be.⁣ have you experienced stress and anxiety first thing in the morning? which reminder did you find the most helpful? what helps you navigate negative thinking? i’d love to know xx we are still looking for a brand ambassador worldwide be one of our brand ambassadors now! main account: @montezaofficial shop now on: www.monteza.shop interested????

not worrying about the past or future. just aware of the present moment. if you answered never to this question, you will be challenged by this weeks prompts. dig into that and see where it takes you. 1. think back to a typical week how often do you notice your mind drifting? do you spend time daydreaming or reliving past events? when do you let your mind wander? take an inventory today and notice these moments. 2. categorize your mental fluctuations. are they aspirational? are they distracting you? think about when it’s appropriate to plan, dream, and reflect, and when you can try to be more present and aware of “now.” 3. think about the goals you set for yourself this year. write down 3-5 goals or hopes and list out what steps you are taking to achieve them. 4. think about what would happen if you did not achieve those goals. what might you still learn or gain in the process? 5. think of an achievement that you did not reach on the first try. how did you get there? what did it feel like when you finally got it? did you discover anything about yourself along the way? hit the save button so you can pull this up every morning! happy journaling with my thoughts on these 3 sheet masks @elakokoofficial noni enriched nourishing mask this mask has two key ingredients. one is morinda citrifolia fruit extract, which i have never heard of. this ingredient helps to sooth and moisturise the skin. the second ingredient is nacinamide. we all know what an amazing ingredient this can be, it helps with pores, hyperpigmentation and balancing the skin tone. i found this mask very moisturising, and it had a nice cooling effect too which helps soothe the skin. the mask was very easy to apply, and it had a great amount of serum on it as well as some left over in the pack. i wouls give this one a 45 @detoskinofficial hibiscus tea-time mask this one is my favourite out of the three. it is one of five tea sheet masks from detoskin and this one also contains nacinamide. this mask was super moisturising, however it didn't leave my skin sticky which i loved. i was super impressed with this sheet mask because my skin was plump and moisturised even the next morning this one definitely deserves a 55, and i want to try more of their sheet masks! @ttmukire black charcoal mask this mask contains hyaluronic acid, algae extract and baoba tree extract which all help with hydrating the skin. this mask was my least favourite as it wasn't as moisturising as the other two. also, this mask was too big for my face and kept slipping which didn't make my pampering session as enjoyable i would give this one a 15 as it didn't do much for my skin and was too big. all three masks kindly gifted to me by the gorgeous @alicepluteanu 𝐘𝐎𝐔𝐑 𝐒𝐈𝐌𝐏𝐋𝐘 𝐓𝐇𝐄 𝐁𝐄𝐒𝐓! here’s a close up of design 2 from my new mother’s day card collection i wanted to keep it neutral simple, making it the perfect design for any loved one all a6 cards are printed onto 300gsm white linen card for that premium finish come with a kraft envelope available to order on my @etsy shop now!! link in bio i finally put it into words last night. about how i feel like my creativity comes and goes. but i realized that it doesn’t—it’s always here. it’s the process of transforming that energy into a physical thing that drains me. it’s called the creative process for a reason. i guess i just wasn’t even aware of the idea that i had a creative process because i never considered myself a creative when i was growing up. “but i’m not,” i’d respond to the people saying i am one. i didn’t feel adequate. to me, there were people more creative than me and i was just a casual observer piecing good-looking items together. my energy—my creative energy comes and goes and my focus shifts from time to time but i can’t control it. it’s like a wheel and which ever one of my creative outlets writing, painting, photography, making videos, etc. is at the top is the one that i focus on. i don’t even notice the gradual turn of the wheel until after it happens i am left a manic mess each time until i figure it out again. i’ve been feeling like that for a few weeks now. sometimes there’s nothing on the wheel, they’ve scattered away like tumbleweed to their various hiding places too shy to speak up, only peeking out once in a while. but they always return to the wheel and just keep spinning. be the change you wish to see. starting the week with perfect pink harmony some strong spring vibes waking up too sunshine pink treats which i found on the ground is a good start to this new week, so happy sunny pink monday everyone don’t forget to turn that timer on, in my stories xx if you poured all of the time and energy you spend focusing on other people and what they have achieved into your own self care and development you’d probably have achieved your biggest goals and dreams by now. stop worrying about them and start focusing on you back when i actually used to leave the house during lockdown another day, another slay dress: @bershka heels: @stevemaddeneu eyeshadow: @hudabeautyshop boris, i need a holiday new spring knitwear launching on wednesday! including this beautiful nude knit head to our stories to set your reminder! new spring knitwear launching on wednesday! including this beautiful nude knit head to our stories to set your reminder! sentirsi un po’ grunge case of the monday’s, amirite?

happy monday to you all @home.inspo.daily @decoratingcentreonline @homesenseuk @duluxuk @spotmyhouse [product review] keep cool soothe fixence mist hey everyone! happy just a couple of weeks ago, @kcoolph @keepcoolphilippines gave me the honor to be one of their newest brand influencers keep cool is a korean brand whose main focus is to create products that would keep the skin at a cool temperature for optimum complexion health by using traditional korean medicine and other natural ingredients. they are cruelty-free and most of their products do not contain any harmful chemicals. along with the pr package that they sent me was this keep cool soothe fixence mist which i was pretty excited to try. claims a 3-in-1 reversal bi-phase “fixence” mist infused with centella asiatica and other fruit derived extracts that provides excellent moisturization to the skin and calms sensitive skin. this can also be used as a makeup setting spray. my experience for me, this product was really refreshing. it gives off a cooling yet short sensation on the skin which i love and will probably enjoy more during the hot and humid summer season here in the philippines there’s an herbal scent to this that does not linger. being a bi-phase product, it is important to shake the bottle first, enough for the oil and the water to mix, before spraying. the spray bottle it comes with doesn’t provide the finest mist but it still gets the job done although a mist isn’t really that essential in anyone’s routine, it ain’t a bad idea to carry one while having a walk in the park during a bright and sunny day or while on a beach or camping trip when you need to quickly freshen up as someone who doesn’t wear makeup, i really can’t vouch for the effectiveness of this product as a setting spray srp: php 420 60ml go check out my bio for a link to the @kcoolph official shopee store for more keep cool products! pr co @kcoolph in exchange for my honest review creamy cream ᴡʜᴀᴛ ᴀʀᴇ ʏᴏᴜʀ ᴍᴏɴᴅᴀʏ ɢᴏᴀʟꜱ? have you been waiting all week to start again today? whether that’s eating healthily or generally feeling good. what does “start again monday” actually mean? i said this all the time when i was overweight. every monday i would start right by eating better but if i had one slip up, no matter how big or small, i would always allow those daily bad habits to transpire into a whole week of unhealthy eating. i might have had the right intentions every monday but i definitely didn’t have the right mindset. food only lasts for so long until you start feeling hungry again a healthy mind and body will last much longer. don’t live your days waiting for monday to come back around so that you can start again. start tomorrow and you’ll be one step closer to reaching your goals. no thanks no thanks this girlreally thinks this is her bed! thanks so much to @downlitebedding for gifting me these great pillows. these could not have come at a better timing now that i just got a new bed and really needed more pillows going from a queen to a king. i have to say i have a few of their products and love them! i have a code dygen20 for you guys if you would like to try any @downlite products! happy monday beautiful people! can i be honest? as people, we have a tendency to dwell on the past and focus on the things that we can't change. we know that this way of thinking is not healthy, not worth it and does more damage than we think but we entertain it, counting ourselves unworthy of having a brighter present and a better future. so today i want to challenge you to intentionally stop dwelling on the past and here are a few ways you can do so forgive yourself and those who wronged you and move on. moving on doesn't mean that those people that hurt you need to come back into your life, but it simply means that you are no longer going to allow unforgiveness to consume your heart and disturb your peace focus on the present.⁣ focus on how you can be a better version of yourself. whether that be eating better, having the courage to apply for a new job, enrolling onto a new course, or learning something new, go for it!⁣ intentionally choose to enjoy today. you don't need to wait for this global pandemic to be over or to achieve something else in order to enjoy where you are today. there is a saying that says don’t wait to live your life, so don't. live today helsinki february 2017 we love a summer holiday as much as the next person, but there something special about a winter break i cannot recommend enough when we can. i will never forget how gorgeous the views were on our trip to helsinki. the first photo is just a tiny snapshot into the helsinki skyline and the perfect scandi furniture right in the centre, but the whole city is drenched in design and beauty and if you can survive the absolutely freezing waters across to unesco world heritage site suomenlinna i would highly recommend it. along with all its history, in winter, it had the most breathtaking views i’ve ever seen, the photos just don’t do it justice. my back had almost crumbled by the time i returned to england under the weight of the amount of layers i needed to wear hello -13 but it was so worth it. even if a pint is £7.50. success happens if you're consistent so it doesn't matter how long it takes you to reach that success, just remain consistent. happy beauties! today, i'm taking part in with the @bloomteas absolute matcha, which is ceremonial grade, so top quality! i ordered a sample pack from them and this came with it i love whether it's drinking it as a latte, or even just plain, it's a winner for me all round! and also having a bit of a facial massage session using my @aquamarinabeauty opalite gua sha and @thisisminimum restoring facial oil!the scent of this oil really tops the experience off! and not forgetting my @honestlybareskincare orangegeranium hand butter that smells like chocolate orange and turkish delights! it's also been keeping my hands soft and nourished as i like to apply it after every handwash and even use it as an overnight hand mask! how's your monday looking today my lovelies?

𝐹𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑒, 𝑙𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 𝑖𝑡'𝑠 𝑎 𝐻𝑦𝑑𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑜𝑛𝑒 i love products having tiny yet important features, they make the product stand out this sunscreen has a long nozzle which is really convenient. the texture of the product is great for people with dry to combination skin. i love how beautifully it glides on the skin without being heavy not leaving any white cast at all. this is a sensitive skin friendly product. note: this sunscreen can ball up on serumgel like product so better use it on any moisturizer also layering this product with foundation can be a bit tricky so keep that in mind. i'll anyday prefer a sunscreen which doesn't leave white cast over a tinted one because most of the time it fails to have the exact shade which ultimately makes it a failed product. investing in a sunscreen that is not going to provide any white cast is way better than investing in one that requires long time to get blended or a product that need foundation to cover it's white castatleast i don't have enough time in the morning to so, i need a readymade one if that makes sense also i would like to mention that the spf factor makes only fraction of difference in terms of sun protection, spf 30 and spf 50 only has a percentage of difference in terms of sun protection. moreover, if you're applying higher spf and not layering it following the 3 fingers rule to provides proper coverage by making adequate sunscreen layer on the top of the skin, it'll not be fruitful. this provides enough protection from sun-rays but for excessive sunny,humid weather, i prefer using spf 40 atleast, instead of this. this is on the pricier side but worth the money. @aveneindia 𝗜𝗻𝗻𝗶𝘀𝗳𝗿𝗲𝗲 𝗚𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗻 𝗧𝗲𝗮 𝗦𝗲𝗲𝗱 𝗖𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗺 𝕆𝕍𝔼ℝ𝕍𝕀𝔼𝕎 the innisfree green tea seed cream is a soft cream that claims to deliver refreshing hydration to replenish skin's moisture levels for healthy radiant complexion. it contains green tea seed oil and green tea leaf extract, which imparts the antioxidant benefits to this cream. 𝕂𝔼𝕐 𝕀ℕ𝔾ℝ𝔼𝔻𝕀𝔼ℕ𝕋𝕊 𝘎𝘭𝘺𝘤𝘦𝘳𝘪𝘯 𝘚𝘪𝘭𝘪𝘤𝘰𝘯𝘦𝘴 𝘊𝘢𝘮𝘦𝘭𝘭𝘪𝘢 𝘴𝘪𝘯𝘦𝘯𝘴𝘪𝘴 𝘗𝘢𝘯𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘯𝘰𝘭 𝘚𝘰𝘥𝘪𝘶𝘮 𝘩𝘺𝘢𝘭𝘶𝘳𝘰𝘯𝘢𝘵𝘦 𝘛𝘰𝘤𝘰𝘱𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘰𝘭 ℙ𝕆𝕋𝔼ℕ𝕋𝕀𝔸𝕃 𝕀ℝℝ𝕀𝕋𝔸ℕ𝕋𝕊 𝘍𝘳𝘢𝘨𝘳𝘢𝘯𝘤𝘦 𝔸ℙℙ𝕃𝕀ℂ𝔸𝕋𝕀𝕆ℕ it is definitely one of the softest creams i have used thanks to the the silicones used in the formulation! it applies very smoothly and easily onto the skin, but it absorbs quite slowly and leaves a film for a longer time compared to other less silky creams. 𝔼𝕏ℙ𝔼ℝ𝕀𝔼ℕℂ𝔼 this has been my night-time moisturizer for a while now, and i really appreciate how it leaves my skin soft, supple and bouncy. the downside of this is that it leaves a film over the skin, which i'm usually fine with but sometimes it does bother me. i only use it in the pm as it would probably be too thick for my skin in the am. 𝕍𝔼ℝ𝔻𝕀ℂ𝕋 i think it makes for a good moisturizer in a basic pm routine, but i would also say don't expect any miracles or powerful effects from this cream. this works best as a neutral cream for basic maintenance purposes, eg. when you just want to take a step back and reset your skincare routine, or if you prefer a simple routine. it is also really emollient and so great for achieving supple bouncy skin. but if you are looking for specific functions like barrier healing, soothing, brightening etc then perhaps it would be better to find something else. have you tried this?

happy monday here are the items i’m focusing on this week. my tiny decisions app chose my @lagirlcosmetics pro mastery palette, my @kajabeauty bouncy bento trio in spiked ginger, and my @lorealparis age perfect radiant serum foundation. i chose the @tartecosmetics in bloom palette to accompany them. there’s nothing particularly colorful to play with this week but all of these eyeshadows perform beautifully and i don’t have to think about my eye look. a neutral lovers dream. you know how i feel about my kaja eyeshadows, and most people already know about the tarte amazonian clay formula so i will talk about the l.a. girl palette today. this pro mastery palette is a dream to work with. the pigment, the formula, the color story. i love it all. if you’ve seen my swatches before you’ll know i’m a pretty light swatcher and even with my light hand these colors have pigment. the mattes are lovely but the shimmers are the standout. i’m not going to say dupe but i will say the shimmer formula is reminiscent of the natasha denona formula to me. so creamy and full pigment with one swipe. i haven’t tried any other la girl eyeshadows so i have no idea if the formula is consistent throughout the brand but i will firmly stand behind this palette. have you tried anything from la girl? prgifted swipe for swatches all of these swatches were done in the same period of time but the sun kept coming out and going behind clouds so some pics look more cool and some look more warm. please excuse the inconsistency. we’re so proud to be this little lady’s fur parents turtleneck game strong are you an eggs bacon kind of breakfast eater, or do you prefer pancakes waffles?! 9 times out of 10 i honestly would pick the avocado toast and eggs. seems a little out of character since i love dessert so much, you’d think anything with maple syrup would be calling my name but i really need to be in the mood early in the morning so what’s my go to? any style egg with avocado today it’s an avocado egg boat messy? maybe. but delicious fun? start to finish this will take you 5 minutes to make. all you need is a couple eggs, some fresh spinach, a little chopped onion cheese optional of course, 12 ripe avocado. scramble up your eggs veggies fill your avocado boat happy monday! let’s make today a good one! i saw my friend @repsresistanceresults post a monday pic this morning that said “ok, it’s monday. but who said monday’s have to suck. be a rebel and have a great day anyway!” that’s exactly what i needed to hear this morning! it’s not too late to turn the day around! hey! i hope you are having a good day today! the sun has been out here and it’s getting me so excited for spring!! though i’m pretty sure that a glance at my profile would already tell you that i am i hope you like this illustration it’s on my etsy shop now as a mother’s day card! i’ve completely based this of my mum @sarahwindleart and i and i’m really missing being able to go and sit in a coffee shop! i can’t believe how fast february has gone already, i really thought there was still like a month until mother’s day!

we will be cleaning up from our purge day and making room for a new dining room table i bought on marketplace this weekend i’ll also be sharing a super easy diy i threw together last week! what are you up today? how absolutely gorgeous is @xmaddiethompson in our grey and silver lace logo set i don't know why i did this but i did the smileys are smiling for me cardigan- @depop t-shirt- @urbanoutfitters skirt- @topshop tights- bought years ago boots- @ebay wonday or monday. make this week awesome, you can do antyhing in this world. mondays face is popping by with some popping pink eyes!!!

it’s a match my my sunshine the scent i’ve been reaching for daily. i really love that @helioscents are gender free and that they smell really personal rather than abrasive. smell is tied to memory and anytime i go back to an old scent i used to wear, it feels like time travel. can’t wait to make new memories that i’m gonna associate with salt lick 222-2021 happy monday, my friends! remember today to find joy even if it's in something small, like a cup of coffee. is a very wonderful thing. thanks to maskne, my blackheads have been something else lately, so i decided to go with an old standby. as i've mentioned before, when i first started my @cosrx was the brand i trusted most. they're inexpensive and their products work. i had cystic acne and also some really wild blackheads! this stuff cleared up my skin, and so i know reintroducing it into my routine is worth trying again. bha's are great, because they help minimize and unclog pores, remove dead skin cells, and decrease inflammation from acne and rosacea. bha's can even out your skintone and also improve your skin's texture. i treat this like a serum and use it while my toner is still wet, for best absorption. i finally just started using it again, so i'll keep you updated how well it helps me this go 'round. according to reddit, it may make my skin purge this week- so, stay tuned!

my boyfriend bought me the drunk elephant littles set. he noticed i didn’t have anything from the brand and thought i could try some things, which is very sweet and observant of him c-firma day serum 8ml: unfortunately i didn’t enjoy this product. i have a lot of vitamin c serums that i adore, but this one will not be joining the club. it has a strange smell, like burnt plastic, and is excessively sticky! t.l.c framboos glycolic night treatment 8ml: i did enjoy this! it is very light and absorbed beautifully. my skin loves glycolic acid and i didn’t find this too strong or experience any stingingredness. i think i noticed an improvement in texture and glow while using this although i liked the glycolic night serum i’m not sure if i’ll purchase again. find minis quite stressful, they’re often not big enough to see if they actually work. they’re great to see if you don’t like a product but i don’t think you can really tell if they’re working for you. i’d prefer if they were at least 15ml!

my hair has never been so soft, silky, strong and shiny and i have to thank this @christopherobinparis hair mask.⁣ the regenerating mask with rare prickly pear oil reinforces and protects my hair from the roots to the ends. i use it once a week and i apply it from the roots to the ends. i love the fact that i can apply it also on the scalp to add moisture and sooth the itching. the texture is rich and luxurious, it’s enough a really small amount of product because it’s highly concentrated. the negative part is that it is a bit pricey. however i have to say that it is worth every penny, because the results are amazing and if you use a tiny amount of product, as they recommend, it will last up to 4 months. have you ever tried their products?

let us know!! sidenote: i might have to create a section on our website specifically for asian food because there's so many recipes now, what else shall we make? ready for spring i am obsessed with this dreamy lounge area over at the loft you need to check out @redwhalerentals happy monday ladies! baby blues tried to recreate @sonukakkarofficial di's look for jitni dafa cover! i'm not looking even 10 close to her because she is simply gorgeous!!! btw, now since i revealed my look, let me also announce that the video is dropping shortly on my youtube channel. buffalo mozz hands up who thought buffalo mozzarella was a gimmick to get you to spend more money? hands up who was wrong? this pizza from rudy's is a great way to try buffalo mozzarella in it's entirety. it's creamier, softer and just has a real flavour to it. made from water buffalo milk instead of normal cow milk, it's also stronger and tangier. y'know how sometimes you sit and think normal mozz doesn't actually taste of anything? that's not the case with buffalo. it does have a higher fat content than normal mozz all the best things do it seems, but if we close our eyes and just ignore that, it'll be okay once you try it, you'll never go back. i love it that much i started eating before i remembered to take a picture have you ever tried buffalo mozzarella? what was your verdict? two of the most talked about products being tested over on my yt now link in bio @elfcosmeticsuk @maybelline i have been waiting so long to get my hands on both of these products thanks to the sister for buying the cc cream for my birthday and let me tell you...i have thoughts! have you tried any of these? what did you think? review: be plain i received these products complementary from @beplainglobal and @bazzaal but as always, the following is my honest opinion and experience. cruelty free fragrance free i’ve been really impressed by this line- i’ve tried six of their products and have nothing bad to say about any of them! they have all been a joy to use so far. greenful ph-balanced cleansing foam foaming cleansers are often too drying for me, but i didn’t find this one stripping at all! i am not usually a fan of physical exfoliation, but i really enjoy the incredibly gentle exfoliation from this cleanser. i’ve really been enjoying this. cicaful ampoule this serum is really restorative and soothing. it has a bit of a more viscous gel-like texture, but it becomes more watery on the skin and absorbs easily and feels nourishing and non-sticky. cicaful ampoule ii this serum is also light, soothing and hydrating and absorbs easily into the skin with a non-sticky finish. it feels more hydrating than the original. greenful bubble wash-off mask this is the first bubble mask i have tried and it was such a fun sensorial experience! it was like my face was fizzing! this mask was soothing, moisturizing and fun. i already have lots of masks but i am definitely considering purchasing a full size of this one. cicaful calming mask this sheet mask was incredibly soothing, nourishing and moisturizing. this is one of the sheet masks i have enjoyed using most. it has a ton of serum in it and absorbs to leave a non-sticky finish. bamboo healing mask this sheet mask felt super restorative, soothing, and moisturizing- all at once! i really enjoyed using this one. on the back they have a qr code you can scan to enjoy an asmr playlist while you mask. naturally, i listened to the playlist while masking and it was a fantastic experience. this sheet mask was also non-sticky, a huge plus for me. what brand has been impressing you recently?

i don't know if it's psychological and i'm associating it with having a facial, but i fall asleep every time i use it. they recommend at least 2 months use before you see any benefits, but my skin definitely feels plumper and smoother, it feels much less reactive and seems to be healing faster, so i'm excited to see what's to come! it was an expensive investment, but the cost per wear is much cheaper than having led treatments at a clinic or salon, which i can't do at the moment anyway, so this has been a welcome addition to my routine. i chose the @currentbody mask for a variety of reasons. it's not cheap, but there are far more expensive ones on the market, it uses a mixture of red and infra-red light, which is clinically proven to yield the best results and has the most research, and, because it's a flexible silicone, it moulds to your face, ensuring you're getting the best coverage for your skin. @goalstogetglowing has an amazing overview of lots of different types and brands if you're curious on others!

layers layers layers back at it and feeling good! i wish i brought 3 bottles of this moisturizer with me from moscow. it’s a russian skincare brand @dtmskin owned by a first actual russian skin influencer who taught me what salycilic acid was. i love that this brand sends “less is more” message, as well as cares for skin microbiome. what is more, it is formulated with sensitive acne-prone consumers in mind. this moisturizer smells like oats and has ceramides in it, and it’s literally the most comfortable and silky moisturizer i’ve ever tried. i just wish they shipped worldwide so i could include it in my possible giveaways so you guys could try it and see for yourself haha. anyways, what’s your current favorite moisturizer? filmed a soft spring look today!

i have so much work to do this week but i am beyong excited to present my colorful collection on sunday how do you gua sha? ever since i uploaded my ‘self care sunday’ routine, i’ve had many questions particularly about gua sha and face rolling. typically, i gua sha and face roll about 4-5x a week as part of my night time skin routine. it takes me about 5-6 minutes for each targeted area, i massage it around 10x and in one direction only. i have noticed a huge improvement ever since i’ve religiously made it part of my routine. i suffer from an auto immune condition called sjrogens syndrome. one of the side affects is that i often experience inflammation in my parotid glands, resulting in severe pain and swelling. every year, i have a procedure to inject antibiotics into my glands to unblock them and i hate it lol. however, ever since adapting gua sha and face rolling into my routine, i haven’t had a flare up since touches wood. it seriously has helped my tissue circulation and reduced this inflammation. at the same time, i’ve also noticed that my skin is so much more smoother and the contours are more defined if that’s what you wanna call it. don’t get me wrong, at the beginning i was a little sceptical. i thought it was gimmicky and just another fad trend. however, i’m so glad i’ve been converted! here are some key facts about gua sha and face rolling: relieves stress tension in face muscles boost blood circulation encourage lymphatic drainage to reduce bloat results in skin looking more lifted skin appears dewy, defined and smoother watch this space for my gua sha and face rolling routine!

i took the weekend off because i was moving to a new apartment now that the move is done, i can get back to my regular posting schedule! and you're in for a treat today i'm reviewing one of the best makeup products i've found in the last year. these are the maybelline lifter glosses, and i own two shades. the one on the left is silk cool-toned medium pink and the one on the right is moon shimmery cool toned light-medium pink. there's ten shades total in this range of lip glosses, and the formula is infused with hyaluronic acid for additional hydration. y'all i'm obsessed. these are some of the most hydrating glosses i've ever tried. the formulas have serious color payoff especially silk, they're incredibly comfortable to wear, and they're not even the slightest bit sticky. i find them to be very similar to the fenty gloss formula but with even more hydration and a coconut scent. i can't recommend these glosses enough and would absolutely recommend. 55. product cost: $8.99. image id: two pink lip glosses standing side-by-side on an outdoor wooden table. @rekreatedthreads is celebrating it's first year anniversary prepared for your timeline to be flooded i’d be lying if i said that eating frozen yogurt in frozen temps is particularly comfortable but how cool is this igloo?!

let’s talk sustainability i truly appreciate the brands that understand their corporate social responsibility, and make efforts to reduce their carbon footprint. oftentimes, sustainable packaging is even more beautiful, thoughtful, and functional. @themobbeauty has an earth-first approach to their packaging, sourcing sustainable materials and striving to reach 100 post-consumer recycled materials for all of their packaging. does sustainability play a role in what you choose to buy? not feeling this whole monday thing but at least it’s almost over!

bojo providing us with all the good news and hope today so excited to get back to a pub garden and see my lovely hairdresser and beautician another couple of ways to wear croc trousers with a pop of colour or a classic all black vibe one thing about me… i love a body butter and i’m always down to try a new one. i’ve been trying this luxe body butter by @herbaldynamicsbeauty. this is their hydrasoft shea and squalane rich body butter. some of the highlighted ingredients of this body butter includes mango butter, shea butter, mowrah butter, pistachio oil, aloe, and squalane this body butter is very hydrating and not heavy at all. it melts into the skin with ease. i would say that this body butter is great if you do prefer lotion and want something slightly thicker, but also not too thick. it also has a unique fragrance that was very fresh to me. it’s not the average scent that you usually find it body butters it reminded me more of a perfume i did enjoy this product and i did like the fragrance because it gave me a luxurious feel. i wouldn’t say that it was my favorite of the body butters i’ve tried as i do typically prefer thicker formulas this product was sent to me in pr, however, all views are my own. tomorrow’s work outfit sorted day 22 b is for.. blue! @mynortheasthome obviously i had to use my blue wall for this post! i’ve loved the last couple of days just because they’ve been so bright it really uplifts my mood! even managed to catch some rays through the window hoping for some positive news from boris this evening because i think we could all do with a bit normality back in our lives me and my sweet tooth are very pleased with the @bubbletcosmetics strawberry macaron hand and body cream, which arrived in the february @lookfantastic subscription box! this buttery cream can be used on your hands or all over your body, which is what i like to do. the formula isn’t sticky and it sinks into the skin very fast. as the name suggests, it smells incredible the scent is very sweet with notes of fresh strawberries and it lingers on the skin for a good few hours, which i appreciate. it is cruelty free, vegan and also paraben free. instead, it contains aloe vera extract and shea butter to nourish the skin. issa vibe for me last pic in my selena fit that made me feel like a pretty pop-star princess monday morning reality it felt good not wearing many layers on today’s walk this picture is making me long for the hairdressers to re-open d a y o n e day one of my week off and i’ve put together an ottoman, dropped my car off to get fixed, walked the dog and worked on our website all day!

so i just wanted to share if you find yourself in the same boat, it's okay to not feel okay and to cry, but don't forget how amazing you are. the girls stunning personalised pjs are from @willowandfleuruk you can get 10 off with our discount code charltwinnies10 queen of fcking everything!

this line aims to repair the molecular bonds in your hair to improve elasticity, seal split ends, prevent breakage, and detangle. i have super dry, moderately damaged, coarse type 3 curls. we’ll be snatching the tea and spilling the wigs on today to see how this works on curly hair! the shampoo: by far my favorite of the whole line. i’ve never tried anything like it. the smell is just...intoxicating? it gives a good clean without being drying to the hair at all- my biggest concern. i usually detangle with conditioner but this began to melt my tangles in a way i’ve never seen with a shampoo. my curls already started clumping together and bouncing back. blown away. the conditioner: i enjoyed her! it’s a good conditioner but not enough moisture for my hair type. i think those with finer hair types would love this. i used this to finish detangling my hair and while the slip was okay, the shampoo surprisingly did most of the work. it did a great job at reshaping and bringing life to my curls when i used this after having straightened my hair. the multi-task repair treatment: this is a watery, hair “serum.” it’s pure bond repair in a fluid. this intentionally gives no moisture but is just meant to be the treatment step in your routine, much like a serum. the brand recommends following up with a conditioner. i mixed it with a hair mask! it worked well at restoring my curls but it was a little difficult to use since it is such a runny texture and i gots a lot of hair. you can also use as a leave in treatment which i gotta try! the closer: a leave in hair cream that instantly seals split ends. i have lots of split ends from heat and environmental damage and i was impressed! upon application, even on dry hair, you feel the hair become smoother. it didn’t get rid of all my split ends but made a big difference i need a trim lol. will you be purchasing from this line? vibes were inspired by my queen and angel, @desseydoll. i love you deep. gifted via @octoly @amika @sephora their revamped kure bond repair collection that launched today bond repair seems to be all the craze these days, as it should!

a nourishing face wash in the morning really helps me to kick off the day and the rice wash from @tatcha is great to wake up the skin, making it feel clarified, luminous and soft. first off, tatcha never disappoints with the packaging. i love this squeeze tube, which makes it so easy to get the right amount. a little goes a long way! the creamy texture has bits of rice powder in it, which lathers well and provides a super gentle exfoilation. it is also another ph neutral cleanser so it does not strip the skin dry. together with okinawa algae blend and hylauronic acid, it helps to capture water to the skin, and replenishes ceramides to protect skin barrier, leaving the skin feeling super soft and moisturized. it also has a refreshing scent to it, that's super relaxing for me. and it's interesting to know that japanese women have been using rice water in their beauty rituals for centuries. they literally take the rice water that they washed the rice with to use on their skin and hair because it is a rich source of vitamins and proteins to make their skin feel soft and luminious. how amazing is it now, that we can just get the benefits of rice water in a tube!

it’s monday and im moody happy national margarita day! monday just got so much better. have you ever had a spicy margarita? my favourite recipe below: 50ml of your favourite tequila 25ml of triple sec juice of half a lime a bit of salt and some hot paprika for the rim of the glass a few slices of jalapeño try infusing the tequila with the chili for 10-15 minutes if you like a kick! a splash of sparkling water a handful of ice save, share and enjoy! monochromatic moment it’s been a relatively sunny day today so why not break out the pina coladas!? well, the @fanta equivalent at least i picked this up from @ifoodsuk in the clearance section. go check it out, there’s so much cool stuff on there and you can also use the code chewsnacka10 for 10 off! i’ll be honest, i’ve never tried a pina colada. i’m not a massive drinker so cocktails have escaped me really. this is nice though. a pretty decent mix of coconut and pineapple flavour. really clever from the guys over at fanta hq. as with all of their us drinks, there is zero fruit juice in this drink. there’s ‘100 natural flavours’, the rest however is a mystery. one thing i can tell you is in this drink is sugar. well, corn syrup to be precise. by the bucket load. i had to re-read the blurb on the back. it states there’s a monumental 122 of your daily allowance of sugar in the bottle! so, i’ll be drinking this in a couple of sessions i reckon insane amounts of sugar aside, this is pretty good. verdict 710 have you tried the pina colada fanta? let me know below! it only takes one person to change your life and that‘s you.️ save it if you like my content to support me. anzeige weil markierung. these two tone jeans are perfect for indecisive people like me, to quote the great hannah montana, you get the best of both worlds. tagged on my @liketoknow.it monday megs is wearing our new charlie top matched with our vintage risen denim!!

two weeks around vietnam felt a little rushed so i’ve definitely got plans to revisit and check out some more of the country at a slower pace...some day soon at least. slow vs faster paced travel is an eternal debate, but i think i actually fall somewhere in the middle... another monday, another week to embrace whatever comes our way this week we're challenging ourselves to not just go with the flow...but to grow with it no matter what obstacle we might face this week, let's make a conscious effort to embrace it and learn how we can grow from it little mind shifts that encourage us to step out of our comfort zone can make a big difference. when's the last time you challenged yourself? ready to join us this week? drop an emoji in the comments below if you're in our pantry vinyl labels can be personalised with any wording you wish. this order has sultanas, bicarbonate of soda, baking powder, choc chips along with some of your everyday pantry items available on etsy to order life is way to short for bad vibes don't mind the tag in this pic!

click the link in our bio to read more about the microbiome and find out how to look after it! today we hear from marina, founder of @reveriesatelier hello! my name is marina, i’m 26, and i’m the founder of @reveriesatelier, a brand of sustainable and colourful crochet bags. i’m italian, but i’ve been living around several other european countries: switzerland, france, now uk, and i guess this mix of cultures keeps inspiring me a lot in everything i do. just one year ago i used to work as a fashion pr in paris, but hey look how much a life can change in such a short time! during the lockdown days back in southern italy, i figured i needed to turn that difficult time into a positive and meaningful experience... and so i started making crochet bags! not only because i really liked them, but most importantly because it was the best way to disconnect from everything that was happening around all of us. the first style i’ve launched, the sere bag, is named after “serenella”, the woman who taught me everything i know about crochet from scratch.. trust me she had a loooot of patience and we wouldn’t be here talking if it wasn’t for her! every bag is fully customisable and made to order, so each customer can enjoy the experience of designing it with me, almost from scratch. this process is not only super fun, but it also helps us reduce waste, environmental impact and avoid dead stock. pick your favourite colours from a wide range of recycled cotton ropes and then decide if you’d like to make your sere bag monochrome or bicolour one shade for the bag and one for the handle. to complete your masterpiece, you can choose to embroider a letter, a symbol, your initials or anything you like.. the purpose is to be creative and have fun! and there you’ll have it, your perfect, unique, designed with you, for you. my piece of advice for all the girls out there would be: i strongly believe that you attract what you are, so remember to always be positive, passionate, believe in yourself and good things will come to you! ‘follow. the. road! keep. hands. on. the. wheel!’ exactly what i didn’t do! swipe left to see my horrific driving handling that isn’t the only occasion i crashed. i also broke a tree and almost reversed off a cliff this all happened in dubrovnik, croatia. my first time ever driving! i have no clue how they allowed me to drive this thing. but they did. and it did not go well. but these events made it so much fun and memorable! plus a huge adrenaline rush! i would 100 do it again, however i reckon i should maybe watch some youtube videos on how to hold a steering wheel first since it's i thought now would be a good time to drop this throwback shot to the last time i made my family's marg recipe.⁠ if you are looking for the best margarita recipe that is guaranteed to sneak up on you and get you drunk, checkout the link in my bio.⁠ it may only be 9 am, but it's 5 o'clock somewhere, right? just craving the 21st of june sharing some samples i received these goodies with a sephora order and i'm excited to try them out. do you spot any favorites? kicking the week off with a pot of gold i love wearing jewelry on a day to day basis and usually mix and match different brands. some jewelry brands i’ve been loving lately are: @sifjakobsjewellery a danish brand with really fashionable luxury designs. my initial necklaces that i almost wear daily are from them @aleyolejewelry a young spanish brand with stylish and yet relatively affordable sterling silver gold plated pieces @apodemia another spanish brand with beautiful designs. some of my favorite rings are from this brand do you prefer gold or silver jewelry?

𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗱𝗶𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗻𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘄𝗲𝗲𝗸𝗲𝗻𝗱? sweatshirt: @thebebrand code:keisha10 for off pants: @target sneakers: @filausa purse: @katespadeny don’t act like i’m average. 5 ingredient cheesecake cheesecake for dummies?! you don’t need a book, i’ve got you hun! look at it, isn’t it the yummiest thing you’ve seen today?! this is my vibrant “post-another-lockdown-announcement- treat” cheesecake, a colourful reminder that summer is coming up and the days are getting longer! i made this stunner with my homemade apricot and pumpkin jam but honestly you do you and use whatever jam you fancy or have! here is the recipe: ingredients 500g mascarpone 2 tbsp plain yoghurt 12 packet biscuits digestivesbiscoffany 3 tbsp sugar optional! jam 12 tsp vanilla extract method 1. put the biscuits in a plastic food bag and crush to crumbs using a rolling pin. transfer the crumbs to a bowl, then pour over the melted butter. 2. mix thoroughly and tip into a greased tin, press firmly down into the base to create an even layer. chill in the fridge for 1 hr. 3. whisk up your mascarpone with the yoghurt and sugar skip the sugar if your jam is quite sweet. pour the vanilla extract and mix well. 4. spoon onto the biscuit base, smooth out the top and chill in the fridge for at least 5 hrs. 5. spread the jam evenly on top of the cheese base and put back into the fridge for another half an hour. 6. decorate and serve! hope you enjoy this new recipe lovelies, now hurry up and make yourself some cheesecake! serums for my neck!⁣ loving these serums that i bought at @watsonsph, 3 weeks ago. they are inexpensive but does the job. i put them on my neck and elbows. i am obsessed with having my skin all in the same tone with the rest and so i am so particular with darkness around these areas.⁣ 1. @freshphilippines booster serum am⁣⁣ a 5 niacinamide and zinc pca containing serum, the formula is very watery and has quite a refreshing scent to it. what made me purchase it was that a lot of studies conducted for niacinamide was done with 5 niacinamide and not 10. concentrations matter a lot in chemistry and sometimes it doesn't mean that higher concentration is more effective. it all boils down to its mechanism of action towards the skin. from using 10 niacinamide, i am now on a 5 one. it is what is used in the original study for niacinamide and i'll follow that for now.⁣ i thought of buying an imported niacinamide but glad i found a 5 in this bad boy.⁣ 2. @quickfxph glow aha toner pm doesn't feel like the traditional toner that is watery but rather feels like a serum. the texture reminds me of the cosrx power blackhead liquid forgot the name but you know what i mean. this smells a bit sour almost vinegary, coming from the acids i guess. it leaves a slight sting but i actually like that feeling. what i can say is that it is very spreadable and one pump covers my entire neck and elbow area.⁣⁣ i love that filipino skincare brands are now serving formulation. give me my actives! i am all for it!⁣⁣ product: @uomabeauty stay woke concealer in white pearl t1 $25⠀ why it’s a pick: don’t you love it when you blind-buy a concealer shade online and it turns out to be your perfect match? it’s so rare and so satisfying. this comes in 17 shades that come in cool, warm and neutral undertones. my particular shade white pearl t1 is for “lightest or very light skintones with a neutral undertone” and i found that to be spot on. i use this concealer both on my undereyes and to spot concealer and i’ve been so impressed. it’s not overly emollient, so it stays put, but it’s also not drying particularly helpful when using on my undereyes since i don’t want to look crepey. i’m happy with the size too 5 ml and the applicator is nice and big. i definitely see myself repurchasing when i run out. new week. new opportunities for confidence. what's thing you can do this week that requires confidence? amen some days i wish i would've started doing this earlier and other days it hits me that my timeline is unique to me when you're younger you set those milestones for yourself, right? mine went something like this: married at 21, have several kids by the time i was 23 be a young cool mom and i wanted to be driving a range rover by the time i was 25 i couldn't tell you how i came up with that timeline, but it was real. i'm so glad i realized that not everyone is on the same timeline. i'm 24, just started a new career, have no kids and very far from owning a range rover haha just remember that you can't be late if you're running on your own timeline pick a color share on your story! only if you want tho better days are comingggggg posted @withregram @abbeyroedel come to the winner’s circle i can’t promise that i won’t hurt you though shirt @sheincurve @sheinofficial @sheinus skirt @torrid say hello to our gorgeous glossy snatched lip gloss let’s talk about off days shall we? i had all intentions of crushing it in the gym this morning, filming my workout as i usually do and feeling like a new person walking out of there. if i’m being honest, it was quite the opposite of that. i’m here to tell you that it’s okay to have off days, not everyday has to be perfectly productive going full force. a lot of times i put the pressure on myself to pack my days as full as possible, get as much done as i can and push my body hard everyday, but today it’s hitting me that maybe i need to slow down, listen to my body and give it what it needs; rest without the pressure of thinking i should be doing more. monday’s are usually the days i try to grind out as much as possible and start my week on a productive note, but it doesn’t have to be that way all the time! sometimes you need to give yourself what you need before anything else, whatever that may be. lesson of the day: take care of yourself; burnout is a thing and i’m feeling it hard today. i’m not very good at “chilling” but i’m making it a goal of mine to practice that, because down time is veryy important. hope you all have a wonderful monday, whether it’s a productive one or a self carereflection day, make it great! when designing this capsule we knew at its core we wanted it to represent ethical consumerism and longevity. which is why we created 5 timeless pieces everyone needs in their wardrobe, no matter your style, gender, height or age simply foll0w instructions below to start gaining new inspiring accounts f0ll0w: @thealignpro @southerncamellia @epic.follow.events.backup @rachcollintheshots @maheliabrowart @plieaustralia @garage.smart @mindfulmattersstore @goodhealthprettylife @ciowilde.aspencottage @terishostak @lorettauzegbu @suburbanmorticia @kristaejore1 @motherlyglam @lovinglymaggie foll0w everyone @epic.follow.events is foll0wing like this post comment telling us your favorite dessert tag 6-10 friends, please each tag in a separate comment the more you tag the better gain for you! go to 10 or more comments before or after yours and engage with them. drop a heart on their comment for extra gain do as many as you like for mega gains. once done head over to @wandering.loop and foll0w the instructions on their live event for extra gain. once completed all steps drop 5 separate comments with your favorite emoji. do not foll0w unfoll0w you will be blocked from future events.⠀⠀ @aditalia keeps making covers that fit my feed i’m sorry loaded lunch bowl kale, roasted chicken breast, air fried zucchini, persian cucumbers, feta, and lemon juice i love adding air fried veggies to my lunch for extra crunch and volume what’s your go-to lunch?

i want to try more from the brand! lunchtime like this are keeping me nothing cheers me up like a bouquet of flowers monday knit vest @zara jeans @stradivarius boots @publicdesire we’re about to have a blue moment with a few neutral shades ofc frizzy hair moment frizzy hair moment frizzy hair moment vg kebab platter, with homemade oven chips, in olive oil and @maldonsalt. wrapped in vg brioche wraps from @tescofood using @eatoumph kebab strips and @vegetarianbutcher what the cluck, marinated in soya yoghurtchivesscallionsmixed herbs garlic granules, sea salt and pepper. both fried off in a little veg oil. reminiscent of a yoghurt chicken recipe i used to make back in the day. banging all the salad and some mayo with crispy onions vg kebab platter, with homemade oven chips, in olive oil and @maldonsalt. wrapped in vg brioche wraps from @tescofood using @eatoumph kebab strips and @vegetarianbutcher what the cluck, marinated in soya yoghurtchivesscallionsmixed herbs garlic granules, sea salt and pepper. both fried off in a little veg oil. reminiscent of a yoghurt chicken recipe i used to make back in the day. banging all the salad and some mayo with crispy onions i've been introducing more and more colour in my life lately, replacing beige and creams. this combo is inspired by the recent look of one of my favourite fashion bloggers @oliviaandalice i'm learning from the best of the best. i will post the full look soon! ostatnio coraz częściej wymieniam beże i kremy na kolory to połączenie jest zainspirowane siostrami olivia i alice sprzed paru tygodni. jak się wzorować, to od najlepszych. so my newest creative endeavour has been to make this vase out of a recycled glass wine bottle! i am so happy with the way it turned out i think it looks so unique especially with my hand dried yellow roses another new interest in my creative brain. both the roses and the vase have been uploaded to my etsy linked in the bio if you are interested in them! so my newest creative endeavour has been to make this vase out of a recycled glass wine bottle! i am so happy with the way it turned out i think it looks so unique especially with my hand dried yellow roses another new interest in my creative brain. both the roses and the vase have been uploaded to my etsy linked in the bio if you are interested in them! mother’s day treatboxes will be available to order by the end of the week, just waiting on a few last bits hope everyone’s monday is a little brighter after today’s news leopard print pink gin inspired for the lovely @rachelkeown075 hope you had a fab 25th! har alltid paraplyen med️ har alltid paraplyen med️ finally a glimmer of normality returning soon well, normality is stretching it but something is better than nothing right?! i hope everyone had a good monday x ooooo shiny if i was an animal i'd be a racoon. i'd collect shiny objects, steal people's left shoes, and eat anything in sight.

mine was pretty chilled, as usual. in today's post, i wanna share my experience with the @hadalabotokyo skin plumping gel.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ how to use: gently pat into cleansed skin on face and neck; use in the morning and evenings as a day and night cream.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ review: i really enjoyed using this product and love that the hada labo tokyo products focus a lot on hydration and keeping the skin hydrated. this gel cream contains an exclusive blend of 3 types of hyaluronic acid which deeply moisturises the skin and plumps it from within to restore its youthful smoothness and it does exactly that. it has a lovely gel consistency, not too rich and it absorbs nicely into the skin. i liked using it as my am moisturiser, to apply before sunscreen. overall, i think that people with any skin type would enjoy this, but especially the ones with normal to dry skin.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ would i repurchase it? yes, i would as i had a nice experience with this product. it retails for £19.99 for 50ml, but i've seen it on offer fairly frequently in @superdrug.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ have you tried this or any other product from hada labo tokyo before? how was your experience? let me know in the comments below.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ pardon the awkward pose, but i forgot how to sit like an actual human. also, peep the new spring vibes for my feed because i can’t wait for winter to be gone. i can’t believe we hit 2k yesterday! thank you everyone for supporting my content and for being here! you guys rock how i walk into the new week i had a chill monday! went to nannies bcoz ma hoofam were busy den went for walkies! dis is me in ma nannie’s garden! i wuv to dig up da plants and pee on da flowers otto i had a chill monday! went to nannies bcoz ma hoofam were busy den went for walkies! dis is me in ma nannie’s garden! i wuv to dig up da plants and pee on da flowers otto lowkey that square toe though. are you overworking? so we’re about to start to come out of lockdown 3.0! hurrah! spring is on the way and the sun is setting later- good things are coming! but are you putting too much pressure on yourself and overworking in this strange world we’re living in? it is too easy at the moment to get fixated on working, working, working, feeling like you have to, because we’re stuck at home. here are a few tips that i use to ensure i’m not overworking! easier said than done, but i thought i’d share! work in small chunks- my brain just cannot function if i sit over my laptop for 4 hours at a time. i’m much better doing 45 mins, little break for a drink or something, and then back to it! give yourself work hours- i’m definitely guilty of still working at 11pm and then trying to go to sleep straight away and wondering why i can’t? don’t let work affect your sleep as it is so important for your health! try and set a work day from 10-6 or something and then relax in the evening! don’t panic if you don’t check everything off your to do list, there’s always tomorrow no need to be revising at 3am!! try not to be distracted by instagram- i will sometimes sit at my desk for a an hour and think i’ve been working away, when in reality, i’ve probably spent a good 40 minutes of that hour just scrolling! put your phone to one side and reward yourself with a quick scroll during a break! working from home whilst in lockdown attire obsessed with the back of this hoodie from @hollisterco swipe for me trying to get a nice pic whilst my boyfriend is sat watching me i thought that this @cb2 pedestal bowl deserved its own post my collection of the ordinary is growing i already started using the resveratrol and the caffeine solution and will do a review of them soon! what your favourite @deciem product? @philipkingsley seem to have taken over instagram, and for good reason. blow drying, pollution, central heating, swimming, or my recent favourite, a wet bun so a little monkey can’t get her paws on it. all these wreak havoc on hair. i’ve been using elasticizer for years. gives my hair just that little bit more ‘bounce back’ when i decide to assault it with any of the aforementioned activities. looking forward to giving this scent a go...egyptian jasmine and mandarin...you’re next. good evening everyone! i hope your monday was ok and you caught the announcements for bringing the uk out of lockdown!! at least we’re actually receiving some positive news for once hey? here’s a couple of pictures of the lovely ‘skye’ hoops the same style that were the subject of my recent giveaway! texturedtwisted gold filled leverback hoops with gorgeous freshwater keshi pearl drops. these have been really popular, so if you’re after a pair get in there quick as they’ll sell out soon! these are a few of my favorite pink things here's a flatlay of my makeup for the week! i have such a hard time believing that it is almost march. i know february is a short month and all but this year seems like it is going exceptionally fast! we are already approaching spring at least that is what i am telling myself to get me through all the snow right now and i seriously can't wait for summer! i am thinking about relocating across the country, and i'm hoping to take a trip to my potential new city this summer to explore and see how i like the environment. then i would relocate there after i graduate with my phd in the next year or two! it's an exciting concept and i can't wait to take steps towards permanently moving across the country. anywho, makeup...this week my focus eyeshadow palettes are the @hudabeauty new nude palette and the @eloisebeauty the queen palette. i'll also be using my @anastasiabeverlyhills riviera palette, along with the other usual suspects: @wanderbeauty unlashed mascara and frame your face brow gel @thrivecausemetics gel eyeliner in lauren black @itembeauty brow chow in medium brown @tartecosmetics gifted mascara @thecremeshop cushion color correctors in green and peach fc:1330 now, this side eye here is for this heaux called monday. she’s a mess london, i miss you! we live here, but we don’t see you. we think of you, but we don’t hear you. we want you, but we can’t reach you. we long for you to be alive again. for all the fun and entertainment to return. for the buzz of the city to keep us going through the day and up all night it’s 8 more weeks until maybe, hopefully, parts of london will reopen. then gradually more and more, if all goes to plan. london, you beautiful challenge! you never stop surprising me. i can’t wait for us to be reunited again come april 𝚐𝚎𝚝𝚝𝚒𝚗𝚐 𝚌𝚛𝚎𝚊𝚝𝚒𝚟𝚎 these pictures perfectly represent my monday holding my head due to my agonising migraine. even posting this hurts hope everyone has had a lovely monday though! new video up! link in bio! this week i have a bit of a belated video from me having nothing to put out, so here's something semi-funny instead. a dramatic reading of a review i recently wrote via @preview.app monday the start of a fresh new week i’ve got my fingers crossed for boris’ announcement tonight full details on my @liketoknow.it account. link is in my bio today my baby turns a month older.... and a month closer to her 3rd birthday... i can't deal! can we go back to this please glow up 2021 loading... this is the year where i glow up.⁣ this is the year where i do things for me.⁣ this is the year where i let go of “what if’s” and stop judging myself so harshly.⁣ this is the year where i stop putting things off.⁣ this is the year where i work hard on me. this is the year where i get my body back and continue to love myself unconditionally. this past year has been tough on all of us. i can hand on heart say this has been the toughest year for me mentally. a lot has changed good and bad! very quickly and i think for the first 6 months from the first lockdown, through summer to the second lockdown, i excelled. sometimes called the 'honeymoon period' where everything is new and exciting not to say i didn't struggle in this period. i also had my cipd to keep me occupied and motivated professionally. as we entered the second lockdown, i was optimistic, christmas was around the corner and i had just finished the first phase of my project and was due to deliver this back to senior management. winter was upon us and with no project and shorter days, my mental health was dipping slightly but i thought i could cope. fast forward to returning to work after christmas, we went into the third lockdown. i believe this is one of the straws that broke the camels back for me! no summer or christmas to keep me motivated, i really started to struggle with remaining positive. unfortunately, i let it eat away inside my mind and i have got to perhaps the worst and best place my mind has been for a long time. i'm trying to focus more on selfcare without a screen, i've started reading again and been hitting 10k steps minimum daily. life is very hard to balance, but i highly recommend seeking help and maintaining routines during these unprecedented times. it may seem small but it does wonders for your mental health. it's the little things that count, like these photos! i bought this outfit for an at home date night and it was such a nice feeling even if we couldn't actually leave the house. let's hope the announcement tonight is a positive one. i hope you're all well, healthy and safe 50 shades of beige @malachilock do you have your driver’s license?

mentally at the beach happy what does self-love mean to you and how do you exercise it? for me it means being good to yourself but also to others. accepting my flaws and seeing beauty inside and out are also important points for me. further, selflove at least for me is not always something that comes naturally to everybody unfortunately. it takes time and practice you have to deal with ups and downs. however, if you feel like you are sometimes failing in selfloving yourself or in self-kindness- try to be understanding towards yourself. you would not judge your friend if heshetheythem is having a hard time practicing it, right? so don't be your harshest judge- talk to yourself like you would to a friend. treat yourself with kindness and understanding you are the most important person in your universe and that's something you need to remember. your are so wonderful- inside and out! sending you lots of love and strength to get through this week! @verenaa.xo dress @zara pullover @sheingermany @sheingermany boots @amazonfashioneu @amazon.de- where in winchester can you find this fairy door?

si es así, haga clic en el enlace en la biografía para ver la publicación más reciente stop comparing yourself i know it’s hard not to, but please please stop right now! comparison is a thief of joy! you don’t need to put yourself down when you’re hyping others up, you don’t need to feel bad just because someone seems prettier, stronger, better than you. your worth doesn’t depend on others! just because someone lifts more weight than you and is stronger, doesn’t mean that you are weak. just because someone is beautiful in your opinion, doesn’t mean that you are ugly. just because someone seems more successful, doesn’t mean that you are unsuccessful. we are all worthy, we are all unique, we all have different abilities and we all start somewhere else. there will always be someone that looks prettier, works harder, is more successful, is wealthier, is stronger or whatever. but that doesn’t take anything away from your worth. you are you and you are beautiful worthy in your own way! the world would be so boring if we would all have the same looks or the same abilities. our differences are what make us unique and that is something you can be absolutely proud of! so stop comparing yourself and next time, instead of putting yourself down after giving someone else a compliment, hype yourself up, compliment yourself for you being your own damn self because that’s what you deserve! nothing less wearing @gymsharkwomen @gymshark training bandeau and adapt animal leggings here’s a fact this was my first time ever shooting at a parking garage!!! how wild, i always knew there was hype around it but i never understood why... until now!! the lighting is beyond amazing, and you get the best views of the sunset!! have you taken photos at a parking garage yet?

this is a picture of two weeks ago, when we were still covered in a layer of snow. i sneaked outside that day during lunchtime for a quick walk to the small forest nearby. i didn’t have much time, but just getting outside, being in nature, watching the birds, connecting to the trees... i realised we let go of that so easily during winter. when it’s dark and cold and skies are grey, it’s easy to get locked up and lost in the in-house life. but going outside, and connecting to nature is so, so important. it can literally heal your soul. i mean that in every possible sense. so do yourself a favour, tomorrow, even if it’s for 15 minutes, go outside and hug a tree or something. listen to the birds, watch the rustle in the leaves. let nature take care of you. lifeandmoon.wordpress.com their is always going to be someone who does not see your worth babe, don't let that person be you! i hope you have a great m o n d a y today i will be catching up on some school work, cleaning my home, heading to the park with the kiddos running some errands comment below what you have going on today dm to order yours today! found my new favorite place in oc do mondays make you feel rough around the hedges?

having a picture of who you want to be helps take the small steps and make small goals to achieving it. for me, she has energy to wake early and smash a a workout, she prepares a nourishing breakfast for her family and gets them to all their activities through the day, and still has energy after they go to bed to enjoy reading, writing and self improvement. on weekends she explores nature and learns from her environment. she doesn’t sweat the small stuff, and knows that we can learn from everything that happens in our lives. what does your healthy women do?

𝔾𝕚𝕧𝕚𝕟𝕘 𝕓𝕒𝕔𝕜 i have been meaning to post this for a while now but haven’t had the chance to do so. with all the holidays and celebrations, i finally had the time to sit down and write this post. before the end of 2020, i was researching on charities to donate to. when i was little, i always knew i wanted to give back, whether it was by volunteering or making a financial contribution. obviously when i was younger, i didn’t have much, so i volunteered my time. as i got busier in life and didn’t have the opportunity to volunteer, i started to make it a point to donate to charities on an annual basis. since 2020 was the year i became a first-time mom, i wanted to make it special and on behalf of blake. i decided to donate to the hospital that delivered blake, as well to sickkids. i was very fortunate to receive the care i did at the hospital from all the nurses and doctors. being pregnant for the first time, i did not know that back pain was a sign of contractions. needless to say, i felt these sharp pains all through saturday. it got to a point that i couldn’t take it and i told my husband to bring me to the hospital to get it checked out. once there, they determined that i was in labour and that i would be next in line to have my c-section. as luck would have it, 3 emergency c-section’s came in and i was bumped down the line. after waiting 7 hours, i was finally taken into an operation room. the care blake and i were given throughout the delivery and our stay at the hospital was amazing. thank you @northyorkgeneral. the donation is a token of our thank you. i also decided to donate to @sickkidstoronto, the hospital for sick children, because being a mom; it hits a lot harder knowing there are so many babies and kids that weren’t as fortunate to living a full and healthy life. knowing that i could help in any small way to make a difference to a kid’s life, made it that much more meaningful. i am hoping that this can touch others to do their part to give back to their community. no help is too small or too little. every little bit counts. wishing everyone a happy monday! we love a carousel post also, boy was i happy to hear the end of the lockdown is near posting these pics because i couldn’t be bothered getting all cute today i canny wait for pubs to re-open, to book a holibob or 5 and to just start going back to normality again monday happy monday friends! i don’t know about you, but i had a really refreshing weekend, and i got to spend it with my dad! we are like two peas in a pod. i always come away so inspired after spending time together! who are those people in your life that truly inspire you and push you to be the best version of yourself?

mine would have to be whimsical or golden hour. products pictured: @physiciansformula butter collection x weylie hoang whimsical golden hour @physiciansformula glow face palette tropical sands @physiciansformula butter highlighter rose gold @physiciansformula butter highlighter champagne sent in pr with no obligation to post or review. all other products were purchased by myself or gifted from a friend. if you are interested in trying physicians formula, you can support me by shopping through my link. i do earn a small commission on anything purchased. https:click.linksynergy.comfs-binclick?ids96igcwhakofferid609820.405type3subid0 all dressed up nowhere to go source @taramays25 it’s monday and i could really use a mani. for years, i wore longer nails with bright, super detailed nail art. but long hours on my computer and a pandemic brought me back to shorter nails and lighter colors. lately, i’ve been itching to go long and fun again—but i’m on the fence. as much as i love intricately designed nails, there’s something to be said about neutrals and classics like @essie ballet slippers and mademoiselle, @opi lincoln park after dark and funny bunny. what’s your favorite way to wear your nails?

it's a happy talent to know how to play. the recent snowfall we had in van, was such a dream. mark and i decided it would be a good idea to wake up bright and early, and drive out to the lake for a snowy walk, before the trails got busy. and it was the best idea! there were barely any people around, and all the fresh snow was so fun to play in. is it just me or do you also feel like such a kid when it's snowing?

reassure me. please say yes and obvs hats off to anyone working parenting at the same time during the pandemic... you're amazing i'm just having a moan! my bff @avafraziermusic released a song last week we co-wrote it together- so proud of her so to @mattharriz for producing it! “detox” out now i must order the dolly light switch, or toggle some call it the white plastic one just does not fit with the scheme! it’s hard to get the fixing as it’s three way i’m all about the little details today i’ve been adding to the designing schedule by organising my own home work space, some beautiful new pieces arriving soon, see my stories for hints will share soon xx i believe i received this @balancemeskincare hyaluronic pumping mist in a look fantastic box a while ago. i used this spray anytime i felt my skin needs more hydration. i prefer using sprays like this to applying more moisturiser as it means i don’t have to touch my face. this spray has a ton of hyaluronic acid in it as well as chamomile oil, pineapple fruit extract and rose oil all known for their anti inflammatory properties to soothe irritation. this spray is 9 natural and does contain essential oils, which my skin didn’t find irritating. i like the scent of this, it smells really calming but wasn’t too overpowering for me. i carried this around with me in this little pouch full of things i might need ever, other things also in the pouch include hand cream my favourite scent is pear from @thebodyshop anti-bacterial hand gel ofc, earrings because who knows when you’ll need them! ketchup big fan, a deck of cards just incase plasters and finally anti-bacterial wipes what things do you guys always carry around?

let me know in the comments being a bit of a germaphobe i have always been one to consistently wash my hands throughout the day. i wanted to share my thoughts on the new @klairs.global 𝐃𝐀𝐈𝐋𝐘 𝐂𝐎𝐌𝐅𝐎𝐑𝐓 𝐇𝐀𝐍𝐃 𝐖𝐀𝐒𝐇 𝐇𝐀𝐍𝐃 𝐂𝐑𝐄𝐀𝐌 that i’ve really been enjoying 𝚃𝙷𝙴 𝙳𝙰𝙸𝙻𝚈 𝙲𝙾𝙼𝙵𝙾𝚁𝚃 𝙷𝙰𝙽𝙳 𝚆𝙰𝚂𝙷 is gel based made with natural scrubs made of almond shells to gently exfoliate sanitize your hands. it is unscented, eo free and super gentle on my hands which doesn’t dry them out and stays moisturized. 𝚃𝙷𝙴 𝙳𝙰𝙸𝙻𝚈 𝙲𝙾𝙼𝙵𝙾𝚁𝚃 𝙷𝙰𝙽𝙳 𝙲𝚁𝙴𝙰𝙼 keeps my hands nourished and super hydrated. i love that it absorbs quick and i actually like that this is unscented since it pairs well with the hand wash leaving my hands so soft! some key ingredients; hyaluronic acid, shea butter birch extract to keep your hands nourished hydrated. also these are both; cruelty free, ethanol free and vegan-friendly gifted by @wishtrend coronamoe🥲 during these times in lockdown it can be so easy to focus on the negative things in life, all the things we can’t or aren’t allowed to do. but the truth is we can not control what is happening. the only thing we can control is the way we respond to what is happening that’s where the power is. don’t get me wrong, the lockdown can really get to me. sometimes i feel completely stuck in life. but i am learning to reprogram my brain, specifically by practicing gratitude, self love and affirmations. and honestly it is changing my life completely. i feel more positive then ever and i enjoy the small things in my life, even during these times. because when you focus on the good, the good only gets better. posting this from our lil trip to greenwich.... i can’t believe they filmed part of thor 2 here that’s it. that’s all i have to say about this did you know we have a brand new kids' party directory on the website?

we are all birds at heart. craving to spread our wings and be authentically free; free to be our truest self. to feel at home in this divine world of ours; to flow with every gust of wind, defy gravity, gracefully collide with the energy of the universe, and find our own harmonious rhythm. yet, we have been programmed to stay in a cage. a cage of false limitations, finite opportunities, zero superpowers; a cage of comfort, stability, “safety”. a cage of illusions. in this cage, we completely forget that we can fly. we have been programmed conditioned ever since we arrived on earth follow the systematic linear path. don’t believe you have a soul purpose that’s too woo woo. hush your unique intuitive gifts. fit in do it perfectly. seek external praise validation. your value on-paper performance. ignore your daydreams, they’re not “realistic”. grind m-f 9-5 dream of retirement instead. check off the status quo scorecard. wear the title “workaholic” as a badge of honor. live to work, while suppressing your soul. none of this considers your unique energetic essence nor divine calling. it’s harsh souldisruptive programming; i lived it for a decade. yet, i’m grateful. it’s all part of our beautiful human experience. we’re here on earth to expand our consciousness, learn our lessons, step into our truth, evolve. without all of this conditioning programming, we have no way to actually heal evolve as individuals a collective. how can you evolve without an environment that provides every single opportunity to awaken, heal, align, consciously create, ascend? it’s time to tune in and remember you are a bird; you are a cosmic infinite soul, worthy of soaring into your highvibrational energetic alignment. if you’re ready to spread those wings, honor your energy freewill, unveil your purpose gifts, i’m here as a channel to guide you. okay i’m ready for june 21st am i right monday night hustle me and my girls are all online on zoom working together, with the the music on 83 babes on a monday night singing, dancing and working away our community is always the best winters in boston treat yourself what’s your favorite dessert?

it does feel a lil tacky once it sets in, but after applying the rest of my routine, i don’t feel it as much anymore. scent: there is a light scent but it’s super light that i don’t notice it my experience: i’ve been using this serum everyday in the morning for around 3 months now. i use it in the morning, because i heard that vitamin c and sunscreen pairs very well together. this was my first vitamin c serum and i think it’s been good to me! my complexion is definitely much brighter throughout the day when i use this and some of my acne spots have faded. i did enjoy the light gel-like texture, but the tackiness is something that i didn’t really like. will i repurchase? i think the price is a bit steep for the amount of product u get. it was a great vitamin c, but i’m probably not going to repurchase it because i’ve been eyeing a few others right now. do you use vitamin c and what are your favorite ones to use mani monday sharing another fab mani using @colorstreet nail strips! if you love doing your nails like me, you gotta try these strips! there are so many different colors and designs! and no dry time!!! that’s my fav part because ya girl always messes up her nails impatiently waiting for them to dry colors used gaelic greenery trend spotted champagne sugar over midnight in manhattan nails linked in my bio it’s monslay a little reminder to make this week your week sunnies from @saintseyewear use code: zules50 for off it’s monslay a little reminder to make this week your week sunnies from @saintseyewear use code: zules50 for off this is exactly what i needed 3 miles in 60 degrees! seasonal depressionsadness is real. weather can take a toll on everyone. february is the hardest month for my mental health ironic how the shortest month can seem like the longest! erik and i try to plan a ski trip or two in february to get away to do something we love even if it’s in the cold we had to cancel one ugh covid but are headed out this week to enjoy the outdoors! things are looking up from here! what are you excited for this monday?! some promising news from bj but i’m being cautious not to be too excited but eeek cannot wait for this to be over anyone else had like a monday monday today?

well, i believe that people who are diagnosed with a disability are easily recognisable, in most cases. however, people with limitations slip through the cracks. don't necessarily get the help they need. don't necessarily seek out the assistance they need or deserves. are viewed negatively by others in society makeover monday but make it natural. this weeks quiz is on beauty. live from 9pm on tiktok on wednesday tiktok: megantlp i know you missed me outfit: details tagged big goals, and i put that on me 38.4 weeks. can’t wait to meet you little guy. 100 celebrating your arrival with a drink i know, summer is disappearing but your shouldn’t! here, i have created this ‘almost autumn look’ with these two fabulous pieces from @postienz you might have seen this strappy muslin tiered dress in many of my posts.. well, i simply love it! also, this black tee from postie is such a staple for me! so, what i have done here is, i have worn the tee over the tiered dress, and have knotted it in the front for the purpose of waistline definition along with some vibes this styling is just perfect for a weather nowadays here in nz where you need a layer but not a dense one. well, as i always say, your comfort and health shouldn’t be compromised just for the sake of fashion! make some way for people! coz, it’s here to stay! do lemme know in the comments below how you liked this styling of mine! these off white shoes needed a post! i love how unique the heels of off white shoes are they’re the perfect shoe if you’re looking for something different and you can easily dress this one down with jeans and a tee! i styled them with this cardigan bu loveshackfancy and jeans bytopshop for an easy outfit for going out to dinner or a low key night out! ship this look at the link in my bio under “off white shoes outfit” last week the sun entered ethereal pisces. pisces is the last stop on the zodiac wheel. it is almost like the closing of a chapter, one more step toward enlightenment and the understanding of the “oneness” of the universe. i always feel it is important to try and embody the positive energy of the sign that the sun is currently in and help your kiddos do the same! you can tap into the energy of pisces by:⠀ tapping into your imagination⠀ allowing yourself to daydream maybe even make a vision board!⠀ embrace your sensitive side⠀ spend some time near the water or take a long bath try to avoid these pitfalls of pisces energy: self-sacrifice to the point of detriment using unhealthy coping mechanisms as a way to escape reality alcohol, drugs, sex, food, exercise, etc. flakiness, always looking for the next best thing and having a hard time making decisions tag a pisces that you love in your life!! wick’d wax is an eco-friendly and cruelty-free candle company based in kuwait. we use 100 natural soy wax and wooden wicks for each candle made, in addition to biodegradable packaging. more information coming soon. stay tuned interior inspo by @espace.empty waiting for spring to come... our bubble candles are restocked on our site for all your shopping desires!!

for me, it gotta be the smell of burnt money aka lighting the candles i spent too much of my mulaaa on luscious gloss: @fentybeauty gloss bomb cream color drip lip cream fenty glow lip liner: @ctilburymakeup lip cheat lip liner pillow talk intense what’s your favorite way to make coffee home?! i have been using the skinny syrups can’t get enough!! swipe to see the reality of my caffeine fun lil grocery haul from @naturamarketca blush palette collection @natashadenona love glow cheek palette this was part of the 2020 valentine's day collection and i had to get this in my hands because of how much i loved her bloom blush glow palette. unfortunately i haven't quite fallen in love with this one as much as the first, but i definitely think i need to give this one more of a shot. i definitely want to make an effort to use it more, especially since i love the glow cream base shade. @natashadenona bloom blush glow palette i think you can tell how much i love this palette considering how used it looks. this is my favorite product i've ever purchased from natasha denona and i hope she comes out with even more color ways in this formula and format. @lunarbeauty moon prism blush palette this is such a great formula, it's not too pigmented which makes it really easy to apply and build to the finish that you want. it's very customizable in that way, and in the way that you can mix and match the shades. i think it's a great travel palette because of this, and it's surprisingly compact while giving you a lot of product. it's absolutely beautiful. @colourpopcosmetics custom blush palette i'm going to be honest and start by saying that colourpop does not make my favorite blush formula, simply because it's too pigmented for my taste and i find you have to be a lot more careful when applying. however, they have essentially any shade you could want in their range. so with my custom palette you'll find all 4 of the @kathleenlights blushes that she created, and one of the sailor moon collab bluhes. the combination of these colors make me so happy, it's so beautiful to me. it's no secret that blush is one of my biggest weaknesses, i don't even know how to photograph my individual blushes because there's just so many of them. it probably stems from being told that i'm so pale, and hearing the oh so uncomfortable you look sick when you're not. i think a lot of us have been there, and makeup just helps me look as good as i feel. blush, being a huge part of that. do you have any favorite blush palettes? let me know below, and as always, take care twinning on this monogram monday with lovely @elegcntluxe we’re casually transitioning into spring here with our cutie, psm she may be tiny but she sure is mighty, and how cute is she with this twilly bow tie as you can see, @elegcntluxe and i both love dressing up our bags she has the most beautiful collection with the cutest bag accessories check out her page to see her lovely collection and awesome reels do you like dressing up your bags?

if i had to choose one, i think i would choose the beach... but i really love beaches that have big cliffs that look like mini mountains. which would you pick? new pr alert: 300 for one 1st vid a quick to not bore you on a monday: @glossier body hero daily perfecting cream 8.4oz250ml for $22 usd fragranced lightly colored w shimmer flip cap @necessaire the body lotion 6.8oz200ml for $25 usd fragrance free no added colorant twist cap first looks: if you look carefully swipe to see, you’ll see that the glossier one contains some light shimmer and has a light pinkpurple hue it’s so pretty but once rubbed in to the skin completely, you can’t really see the shimmer unless there is direct sunlight hitting the spot. the necessaire one is quite pure, nothing added, no colors, no fragrance. my experience: i am usually quite generous with my body lotions because my skin is so dry. the glossier one started pilling when i applied a little too much, likely because it is thick. however, the same didn’t happen to the necessaire one, it is so lightweight! i love how quickly it absorbs into my skin, leaving no tackiness behind. i’m happy about that! packaging: i prefer the glossier’s easy open cap since it is greasy hands friendly but do appreciate necessaire’s minimalistic white bottle packaging overall: i find the glossier one to be more suitable for special occasions and the necessaire more for daily use. i used up half of the glossier bottle since i’ve had it for a month it’s been on pause since i got the necessaire one. i might just save the rest of the glossier one for springsummer since no one will be seeing my shimmery shoulders or legs with my thick coats long pants on these days this dry winter weather really calls for a good moisturizing body lotion, huh! have you tried either? what are your thoughts? small business love what small business should i buy from? @vellicora is one of my fav finds so far! my travels across international waters.

definitely scored on this one love the way this cake turned out and can’t wait to make another similar one this weekend! this was a vanilla and chocolate cake with vanilla buttercream swipe to the end i'm ready to take the plunge...in the pool!! @limelighterrs @dealarea @aahanakumra @angelcroshet today was a good mail day. i received a complimentary box filled with malingoetz goodies to try out. included in the box were the following: grapefruit face cleanser vitamin e face moisturizer detox face mask bergamot deodorant dark rum eau de parfum what a treat! i love citrus so i knew right away that most of the scents would be a hit for me. the standouts so far are the perfume, which is gourmand and fresh at the same time, and the deodorant. the deodorant was a surprise for me but the scent is yummy and it's kept me fresh all day. the face mask is also interesting. it bubbles while on the face. my skin felt clean but not stripped after using it. malin goetz is vegan and cruelty free. @influenster @malinandgoetz new-product-i-am-currently-loving alert!! in got this in my boxycharm this month and i was surprised how much i like it. this gives you a beautiful sheen that is not going to look like a stripe on your face. this does not emphasize texture and it’s very finely milled. so much so that it’s super powdery as you can see in the video. my only complaint about this productshade is that the shade is slightly too icyor light on me. i wish i was just a tad bit darker or gold. there are 4 shades with this being the lightest and the next shade is a big jump and looks too dark.maybe it’s the lighting and i have to see in person to see the shade range. at $45 would i have ever bought it? probably not. do i really like it? yes! i’m really happy with this boxycharm product. what’s a new product you have been loving? product: laura mercier matte radiance baked powder -highlight 01 happy monday i hope everyone had a productive start to the week! my goals this week are to workout and get 10,000 steps everyday the workout: shoulder press 4x15 ss with: wide shoulder press 4x15 lateral raises 4x15 front raises 4x15 upright rows 4x15 incline press 4x15 top: @nikewomen leggings: @lululemon happy monday i hope everyone had a productive start to the week! my goals this week are to workout and get 10,000 steps everyday the workout: shoulder press 4x15 ss with: wide shoulder press 4x15 lateral raises 4x15 front raises 4x15 upright rows 4x15 incline press 4x15 top: @nikewomen leggings: @lululemon ew, david. newness has arrived in store! available in sizes 0000 4. t-shirts and bodysuits. i think i need one in my size too! living for this color at the moment @hm where’s the tyler childers fans at??

product: blockbuster eyeshadow palette $13.52 on sale from $16.90⠀ why it’s a pick: i couldn’t resist. not only does this appeal to me as a movie-lover, but i am a sucker for nostalgia and this reminds me of carefree nights at blockbuster in my youth. the color story here is actually more wearable than i thought it would be, a good mix of neutrals and pops of color. now how’s the quality on this? i’ll be honest, my expectations were super low. i stand corrected though: these are very pigmented, blend out super easy and don’t have a lot of fallout. they were almost creamy in texture too, nowhere near the dryness i was expecting. a good reminder that good beauty comes in unexpected places sometimes. for those old enough to remember the blockbuster days, does this bring back memories for you?

walking around the city always brings me peace 𝙩𝙞𝙢𝙚 𝙩𝙤 𝙨𝙥𝙞𝙡𝙡 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙩𝙚𝙖 i’ve seen so many posts raving about these two products that i finally decided to splurge on them last month do i regret it? read my review to find out 𝙆𝙧𝙖𝙫𝙚 𝙈𝙖𝙩𝙘𝙝𝙖 𝙃𝙚𝙢𝙥 𝙃𝙮𝙙𝙧𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝘾𝙡𝙚𝙖𝙣𝙨𝙚𝙧 𝙈𝙃𝙃𝘾 i really wanted to like this cleanser, but my experience with it is a testament to how personal skincare is. claiming to be a gentle, hydrating face wash, i can attest to its gentleness, but hydrating not so much. as some of you may know, i have combo skin, but with the cold weather it has been on the drier side lately. i was hoping that using this would hydrate my skin, but after 2 weeks in my routine, i’m still left with dry skin and a slight bit of flakiness on my cheeks. i can’t say for sure that my face is even drier than before i used this, but it definitely isn’t more hydrated. also, if you’re wondering, no this doesn’t smell like matcha; at least it doesn’t to me. 𝙧𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙣𝙜: 𝙆𝙧𝙖𝙫𝙚 𝙂𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙩 𝘽𝙖𝙧𝙧𝙞𝙚𝙧 𝙍𝙚𝙡𝙞𝙚𝙛 𝙂𝘽𝙍 swipe left to see an accurate depiction of my reaction the first time i applied this onto my face. my nose is really sensitive to smells and i wasn’t expecting the scent to be so intense. i can’t really put my finger on what exactly it smells like but i guess sort of nutty?? it supposedly comes from its use of tamanu oil. nonetheless, the scent, in my opinion, is the only con of this serum! i truly love this and how amazing it has been at calming my sensitive cheeks through its utilization of ceramides and vitamin b3. not only have i had less breakouts since i’ve started using this, but its moisturizing effects don’t leave a greasy feel and is lightweight enough that i can still layer a separate moisturizer on top of it. 𝙧𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙣𝙜: 𝙛𝙞𝙣𝙖𝙡 𝙩𝙝𝙤𝙪𝙜𝙝𝙩𝙨: will i be repurchasing the mhhc and gbr? no to mhhc, but yes to gbr! the mhhc just didn’t work out for me, but i might try using it again once summer hits and my combo skin is back on the oilier side. on the other hand, the gbr lived up to its hype and while the scent may be on the stronger side, i think i’m starting to get used to it the more i use it. have you tried krave products before? slight work @jeremykeyz @jaecei612 @blackgloveofficial while i know we are meant to be in spring and jumping towards all the bright colours, i just love the colour and tone of this dress from trendyol and it’s only €29 the classic cut will be a dress that will last and can be worn over and over great work to drinks dress i love it and the pumps are the latest release from @michaelkors just fab monday... think i was about to go on some huge rant about it being a new week to crush your goals? well, here's your constructive reality check for the week instead. instead of wishing, start taking initiative and control of your life. simply put, start doing. if you're going to talk the talk, you better be able to walk the walk to back it up. now, let's get to work good morning hunnies how excited i am to share this with you. this brilliant @meccamaxima order arrived today i am so excited to create some beautiful makeup looks with these new products. i’ve done a lot of research i have tried tons of brands over the years. i’ve tested a couple of these items out already i believe i have finally found my go to brands i wanted to share this with you all, as it took me years to find the perfect products and brands, to create beautiful makeup @maccosmetics @narsissist @lauramercier @kosas @urbandecaycosmetics @morphebrushes purchased from @meccamaxima i have tested. i certainly recommend thinking about very important puppy business “we need women who are so strong they can be gentle, so educated they can be humble, so fierce they can be compassionate, so passionate they can be rational, and so disciplined they can be free.” kavita ramdas wishing for the days where we can freely wear lipstick and not worry about it smearing all over our masks!

let’s dive in! this watery toner from fresh is one that has popped up in countless videos, posts, and reviews. it really seems like the flagship product from fresh...but it’s always been one that i wasn’t super interested in. i’ve always thought i had an aversion to rose scented skincare. a lot of rose products i’ve tried in the past have an overpoweringpotpourri odor to them that i can't really handle. but, some more recent products i have tried bring a more crispfresh take to rose or florals that i actually enjoy. the fresh rose toner falls somewhere in the middle for me. aside from the rose oil, rose extract, and actual rose petals...this product is essentially water, glycerin, butylene glycol, fragrance, emulsifiers, and preservatives. it really is a pretty simple formulation that my skin had no issue with. i was happily surprised that i didn't see a reaction or irritation from what seemed to be a pretty heavily scented toner. another surprise was just how well this product absorbed into my skin. for some reason the rose oil and just general “heavy” scent of this product made me think it would act more like an oil-toner hybrid like the laneige cream skin...but it has a nice watery feeling that i think those with most skin types will really enjoy. my skin was always left feeling dewy and refreshed with each application either swiping with a cotton pad or patting in i am more of a patting in multiple layers kind of person. but, that is where the scent really keeps this from being a true winner for me. i don't know what it is...but i had a real mental block about layering the fresh rose deep hydration facial toner. it’s as if it felt more like a perfume to me than a skincare product haha, “don't use too much and overpower yourself”. i ended up using less per application than i normally would with a watery toner and i think my skin could have benefited from additional layers...especially in these coolerdrier months. continued in comments... custom made clothing with your logo branding. we are manufacture and supplier for all kind of menwomen clothes in top quality and supplying our product in the worldwide and we have good repute in the market, you can have your choice of colours... we can place your logo on the products.... you can have customize sizes.. shipping worldwide. dm for query if you didn't get to see or hear my announcements this past weekend here's what you missed every friday i'll be going live or streaming on twitch now i am super excited for this transition and to make it even better i'm finally starting my youtube channel so this friday will be my first stream on twitch and the goal is to get some content on my channel hopefully this week or this weekend if you're just excited as i am then click the link in my bio to start following me on twitch link for my youtube channel will be available tomorrow even though i have no content as of yet you can still hit subscribe to get notified when i start uploading hello i think wunderkinds toys is pretty special, i may be littlebias but a lot of care goes into our packs and i think it’s pretty clear that we’re passionate, wether it’s a slightly crumpled toy bag because orson wanted to “help” bring the bags to the car or it’s an extra puzzle because i know my customer’s little one is in a total jigsaw phase, we always try and go that little extra being a small business can be hard but it gives me the flexibility deliver a service that i’m really proud about, so thought it was time you got a proper look at the whole team this is us, this is the team behind this photo is actually a pretty apt depiction of us. orson, embracing his weird crazy, minna just chilling and going with the flow, my partner dorian holding us together and me, in my sleep deprived bliss. one of the best part about the trip was hands down the food!

the reason why it’s a 9 is because i wish i had more of the product but since its a tiny case it’s good for its price. definitely a cheaper alternative to the lush lip scrub. asteria 810 first impression is pretty good, its a little minty and smells heavenly. it’s also a tinted lip oil and it does have a sheer and sparkly tint. very addicting to put on tbh. definitely see my lips being plumper. this lip oil does moisturize but not as much as i’d like it to. it’s probably cause i’m not using the lip balm. i think for this to take full effect you have to keep on applying but then keep in mind this is a lip oil so i’m not sure if you guys prefer to use this type of lip product as much hehe. medusa 1010 been using this for some time na and it does make your hair grow! i’m only using it on my lashes cause i want longer lashes but then nalalagyan ko yung brows ko minsan and it’s making my brow hair grow quick so it does the job! i guess the only off thing about it is the smell but that’s because it doesn’t have any chemical components for it to change the scent. gaia is all natural that’s why!

hope you have a great day! i'll be honest, i'm not in the best of mood to post, but i felt this is important. qotd you need to surround yourself with people who uplift you, not people who enjoy your misery. you need friends who support you, not people who try and indulge in unnecessary conflicts. you need to be around people who hold good conversations. people who are able to sense your pain and can be emphathetic with you. people who joke around, have fun but the loyalty is unsaid. anything less than that, is just deraling you from your path not helping you. and most importantly, you need to remember that every relationship you have is based on the effort one tries to make not the ego. and also, that liars and manipulaters may know how to work around to make themselves look like a victim, but if you fall for it over and over again, you're the fool not them. as i said before, eventually the karma will come back and bite them in their fucking asses, but till the time being you can do your job and protect yourself.

𝐓𝐈𝐏: love yourself regardless of how many freckles you have or don’t have, rock them, they make you unique and beautiful always remember to take care of your beautiful frecklesskin by applying sunscreen 30 min before being exposed to the sun and to reapply!! good morning...such a beautiful sky this morning, it has set me right for the day just slightly obstructed by all the scaffolding, but it's all about reality right?

the good, the bad and the ugly. so, let’s cover the scary stuff, the part of social media that fill you with dread. the two most common ones i hear are..... showing your face. in videos, photos, posts, stories and lives. we are so good at getting in our own way and not showing up as part of our business. but, try to remember that people buy from people. we as consumers are invested in the person behind the business and their journey. sales. selling our products and services. the fear of the sales stereotype. so, change the stereotype. that’s what i learnt to do. focus on the relationship you create with your audience. build confidence in your skills, abilities, products and knowledge. would you agree? what do you find scary? happy 4 months princess less than one week until opening day! thank you all so much for all the support with my new business so far! i am incredibly grateful and can’t wait to officially get started. can we make it to 300 followers for opening day?

𝙳𝙰𝚈 𝚃𝚆𝙴𝙽𝚃𝚈 𝚃𝙷𝚁𝙴𝙴: 𝙰 𝙶𝙾𝙾𝙳 𝚁𝙴𝙰𝙳 prompt for @thatmamaclub i’m a book fan but only “real” books, reading on a screen doesn’t quite have the same coziness or ability to transport you into the world your reading like a physical book does. as you’ve noticed i’m a big alice in wonderland fan so when i came across these books by christina henry i had to give them a go. there’s 3 in the series: alice, the red queen the looking glass. i’ve read the first 2 already and loved them, it’s a totally different take on the classic more grown up and slightly twisted but fascinating all the same. i can’t wait to get some time to get into the 3rd one. she also has other fantasy twists in her collection: the mermaid, the lost boy, the girl in red and i think there’s another all based on fairy tales. what’s your favourite book? have you read any of these? as long as normal means work-life balance... plus i didn’t realise the orange was giving low-key prisoner vibes! clueless as long as normal means work-life balance... plus i didn’t realise the orange was giving low-key prisoner vibes! clueless the secret of great style is to feel good in what you wear it's march next week?! just let that sink in..... sorry... kind of i love the little floating shelf we have above the sink, i just wish it wasn't glass it'll change in time, for now, i'll spend every other minute cleaning it how's everyone feeling after you know who said what he did about you know what?

sorry wearing @sallyhansenau miracle gel in regal rosé ғᴏᴜʀ ᴍᴏɴᴛʜ ʀᴇɢʀᴇssɪᴏɴ... does it ever end?! i’m so not used to this! xanthe was always a very good sleeper from tiny and fortunately still is now but novie is a different story!!! she goes to bed around 7pm, usually wakes around 1011pm, then again at 1am, 3am, 4:30am and then i usually just put her in our bed, just to get some sleep until x wakes around 7am. it is exhausting, to say the least! she has some milk during the first and second feed but not a lot. she also has a dummy which settles her when she doesn’t want milk. any suggestionshelp would be greatly appreciated! from a very tired mumma anyone else planning airport brunch lunchdinner outfits? here’s a close up from the other day jumpsuit @simplybeuk jacket @inthestylecurve trainers @puma another sunny morning!i think everyone’s ready for spring now right? soo happy to hear of a slow return to our lives yesterday just praying everyone sticks to what we shouldshouldn’t be doing so we can get there when we’re told let’s talk essences..do you use them? do you think they’re a necessary step in a skincare routine? an essence is a lightweight ‘thick’ water formula which is to be used after cleansing and before serumsmoisturisers. their purpose is to deeply hydrate the skin and pull the hydration of the rest of your products deeper in. this drops of youth essence from @thebodyshop contains 3 plant stem cells-edelweiss, sea holly, and christe marine aswell as moringa seed oil and community trade organic aloe vera. the formula is non comedogenic and claims to leave skin softer, fresher and healthier looking. 150ml rrp £15. cruelty free and vegan so my thoughts-i used this once a day mostly, sometimes twice. my skin definitely felt softer. i didn’t notice a huge difference in hydration but when i stopped using it i noticed a difference in how much less hydrated my skin felt so i know it definitely does a good job at keeping those moisture levels up my skin did feel fresher looking so i would say this does live up to its claims, and is a good little addition to any skincare routine. suitable for all skin types, especially those looking for a more radiant complexion which is pretty much everyone right? i think next time i’d definitely use it twice a day. it also doesn’t pill and absorbs straight into skin. soo what are your thoughts on essences? have you tried this one? let me know! here’s the sugar coated mocha cookie from @theflourpotbakerybrighton perfect way to start the morning @flourpotcoffee @flourpotbakery @lotusbiscoffuk @brighton @brunchesofbrighton good morning y’all, i hope everyone is having a lovely start to the week so far. it’s bright and cheery outside. definitely feels like spring is around the corner. did anyone watched boris’ announcement yesterday? non-essential shops won’t be opening until mid april. i was soo looking forward to my little shopping trips to ikea and homesense. i don’t know how i will cope another month. although i might be devastated by the news, the safety of the people and the country is more important. so garden spring cleaning it is in the mean time. anyone else having retail withdrawal symptoms? what do i do when my baby will only go to sleep for one parent? if i had a dollar! i mostly see this with breastfed babes, which makes sense since mum is usually the one putting them to sleep and she is also a massive source of comfort and survival for them. but what happens when you’d really just like to go out for the night and have their other parentgrandparentbaby sitter put them down? not ideal! here are some tips to navigate this situation: get dad involved in the wind down and gradually fade mum out. this can take a few days or several weeks! if your child is older use rewards! get them involved in the process. try to refrain from swooping in mid settle and taking over. this just reinforces that the other parent putting them to bed is bad. leave the house if it makes it easier! it often actually makes it easier for babe too. if they simply won’t that’s okay! try again in a few weeks! will your child only go down for one parent? checking out the ski tracks happy tuesday insta gang! how is everyone feeling after yesterday’s announcement? i have mixed feelings but i am definitely looking forward to getting things back to normal! by the summer i may be able to teach this colourwork class in person rather than on zoom! i will still be teaching online and recording tutorial videos for the foreseeable future but it’s much nicer to have a knit and natter face to face haha. hope everyone has a great day i’m off to go and plan my school run outfits “when it rains look for rainbows. when it’s dark look for stars” after yesterday’s announcement i’m feeling a little more positive about things. there is light at the end of the tunnel, we just have to keep smiling and get through the next few weeksmonths and life will be back to normal whatever that new normal is but i’m looking forward to it. happy tuesday people “when it rains look for rainbows. when it’s dark look for stars” after yesterday’s announcement i’m feeling a little more positive about things. there is light at the end of the tunnel, we just have to keep smiling and get through the next few weeksmonths and life will be back to normal whatever that new normal is but i’m looking forward to it. happy tuesday people jan>feb a flower does not think of competing to the flower next to it. it just blooms i started with holly roughly in the middle of january. i’ve been working with her for about a month and i’ve honestly not felt better. gaining weight is scary, seeing your body change is scary, especially after being underweight for so long but i know i’d never turn back. i have a way to go but mentally, even before starting with hol, i honestly feel like i’m there, i’ve been working on my mindset for a long time but i’d say over the course of the past year, it’s just much clearer and a whole lot more positive. of course i have those days, i think i always will but those are the days that make me stronger. i don’t see exercise as a way of getting smaller, i don’t see it as a punishment. i don’t see food as the enemy, i see it as fuel and a way to look after myself. properly starting this journey and getting an amazing coach to keep me accountable and just be there has been one of the best things i’ve done for myself. i’m fuelling myself properly. i’m smashing my workouts because i have enough energy. im increasing my intake pretty much weekly and yes at first i was scared, and yes i do text holly worried sometimes, but why should i be scared of giving my body the nourishment it deserves? we are told constantly to eat less and do more but that really shouldn’t be the goal! we should have the goal of feeling strong, being able to do that extra rep or to get a quicker 5k time. not all goals should be aesthetic! gaining weight is just so much more that just that, it’s: gaining a life gaining happiness feeling strong having a healthy period. the pros of gaining weight will always outweigh the temporary cons. i know i’ve not physically really changed much this past month my back is looking strong though and i think my legs are gaining some muscle and for many this will mean that they stop but i know this is a journey and it takes time. saying that though, i have gained weight! it just shows that our minds can truly manipulate us when they say ‘eating moreimmediate fat gain’ it just doesn’t and even if that was the case, we need body fat!! cic... the perfect oversized blazer for warmer days the perfect oversized blazer for warmer days big collars are a favourite trend of mine, this shirt was zara last year but there are loads of great ones out there! happy tuesday guys- so lots of announcements yesterday in uk thoughts all over the place, anyone else?

well, we’re getting there! this was taken at the weekend, we now have a porch, the front path is taking shape, and hopefully with this gorgeous sunny weather we may even see some render! i’ll take another this weekend so you can see the progress! it's wonderful to watch your little ones develop their personality as they grow. there's no escaping the fact he's not a baby any more although i'm sad the snuggly baby days are behind us, i love seeing alastair become a cheeky, funny, loving little boy. he adores his big sister and spends a lot of time laughing at seemingly little things. besides, we need to have one person in the family who looks good in a hat featuring my great-grandma's hat and the gorgeous june everyday nappy from @littlelovebum essenziale mothers’ day. so i’ve thought long and hard about what to write today, and whether to put up witty cards on here about a treat being having a poo alone you can find the cards on the website, but as with baby gifts, and fathers’ day, i’m aware they can be triggering. families are complex things, and whether you have an amazing relationship with your mum, whether she’s absent, whether she’s no longer here, i feel i have a responsibility not to ruin your day by going on about a day. mothering sunday used to be all about returning to your ‘mother’ church ie place of baptism, and that’s where the whole family get together thing comes from. even without covid, it’s not always that easy. i spoke to @inkblotcreative about miscarriage not for sympathy, but to normalise on her podcast go have a listen, and i know that for whatever reason mothers’ day can be incredibly tough. the one between miscarriage and a successful pregnancy was a particularly crap one. whilst my lovely mum is still around although natch haven’t seen her in 9months, pandemic and all, i hate fathers’ day as it’s just a reminder that i no longer have someone to give a card to. @harrietandrose tries to be sympathetic to you... i don’t always get it right i’m sure, but i do think before i post. and i do have an excellent array of gifts if you are looking for something. but i’ll never push, i’ll never shove a date down your throat, and i 100 get that sometimes these dates are triggering. and i’ll try and respect that. but man, do i long for a big family bbq with friends and family, with wine flowing, stains being left on the tablecloth you can find this beauty on the website!, and memories being made. this was yesterday’s project and i have to say at last i seem to have made a light fluffy yummy tasting loaf! but goodness me, with 5 hours of proofing it was very long-winded! i used the simplified julia child’s french bread recipe using french flour and yeast from @bakerybitsltd and i think that made all the difference to a continental tasting loaf trying to learn how to make bread has certainly given be a new found respect for bakers up and down the land who spend hours making our daily bread only for us well definitely me! to wolf it down in seconds!! i shall now savour my bread more slowly! a-z baking: c crumpets were an unplanned 'c'...the intention was these chocolate chip and cranberry cornflake cookies enough c's?! adapted from the recipe @meghanwalshblogs posted recently. i tweaked to make them gluten and dairy free and they are so good, so made another gluten and dairy-ful batch for nursery. be warned, the full recipe makes 50 cookies! i'm stumped for 'd'...any suggestions?

i treated myself to some really delicious food and here is just a snippet to give you an idea one thing i want to address is that i know i eat a lot of meat. i’ve got friends who are veggie and vegan and 90 of the things i eat are not recipe-friendly for these people. of course this is something i’m looking to change and i have been researching i still consider steak as a treat meal and so on the days i’m going to have it, i try my best to eat fish for lunch. it’s something i only have twice a week, i feel steak for dinner more than that just screams extravagance where i had time on the weekend my only day off on sunday!

15 people from 12th april 30 people from 17th may no restrictions from 21st june i will resume bridal trials from 12th april ️i am currently working through my emails and will be in touch with my march april brides over the coming days to reschedule your bridal makeup trial. as always thank you for your support and patience. i cannot wait to see you all l a t e n i g h t w a l k s @baileygsdx so boris has spoken, the children will return to school on the 8th! it's a strange one really, as i've been counting down the days since about two weeks into the homeschooling for boris to let them go back, but for the past week leading up to big old boris' roadway announcement i couldn't help but feel nervous, anxious even. nervous to return to normality, the thought of the school run quite literally fills me with dread. i sit with shaniah, 9 2 and begged for boris to ease lockdown so that shaniah can be taught by someone who knows what they're doing. however, once she is tucked up in bed, safe, that is when the worry grabs hold of me. sitting inside on the weekends, with nowhere to go, a child who is asking to get out the house and the only thing i have to offer is a walk down the local lane for the 10374567 time this week, that is when i long for boris to allow us to go further than our front door, but now boris has given us a date for that, i'm nervous, i'm second guessing the big guys wondering if its going to be safe enough. i've had the jab, i'm safer than i was last month, however deep down i feel more vulnerable than ever. i try to tell myself that it's got to be a normal feeling. for over a year now my home and those in it has been the only secure and continuous thing in my life. when everything else was taken away it was the home and those in it that never changed. stepping outside these four walls is going to feel like essentially stepping out of your real life comfort zone. it's got to happen whether we feel good about it or not. i guess what i'm trying to say is, the way i'm feeling is totally normal in the grand scheme of things and if, like me, you're feeling uneasy about boris' roadmap, it's fine. things will be okay. we've just got to take it one step at a time. better days are coming, even if it does feel a little daunting at the minute. enjoy the sun do you use a fitnesshealth tracker? they are really good pieces of equipment with many benefits are they essential for weight loss? nope⁣ remember that they are just a tool to help some people⁣ they aren’t considered gold standard when it comes to measuring daily calorie burn or workouts, as this can be hugely inaccurate but to measure daily steps and sedentary activity they can be pretty accurate⁣ and a good motivator! also if you are somebody like me who is trying to improve their sleep, then they can provide a good insight into the quality you are getting each night. would it be beneficial to sometimes take a break for them? yesdepends...⁣ when on a weight loss journey, whether you work alongside a coach or not you are encouraged to keep as active as possible throughout the day. at present a lot of emphasis is put on the amount of steps we are doing each day, because it’s easy and accessible to everyone. how do we need to be careful? the obsessiveness is the main warning sign, if you didn’t do your 10,000 steps that your required to do each day would you beat yourself up about it? would you feel like a failure? if you didn’t hit a certain calorie target, would you feel it necessary to restrict food intake? if you can easily move on from these situations, knowing that tomorrow is a new day then this is great, but if you are somebody who constantly makes themselves feel guilty if they don’t hit their daily step count or if they haven’t ‘burned enough calories’ that day, then maybe it’s time to take a break...⁣ prove to yourself that you can go out for a walk and enjoy your surroundings without being fully focused on how many steps you have done the learning continues with the @the.gunnclub coaching with @nicolagunn19 lets talk about friends i used to have a lot of friends but as you grow, your friendship groups naturally become smaller. i’m sure there are many people who i thought were friends, but in reality were acquaintances. plus, we grow, we change and we attract new people. i have friends who i’ve known for around 6-7 years, and they know more about me, then friends i’ve known since i was a teen. im fortune to have some amazing friends i also think it’s important to have friends who are different from you whether it’s age, race, sexuality, class whatever! today i’m sharing a perfume that was gifted to me from a lovely friend @idionne she left me to return to america but, we hope to reconnect in sunny california later this year. covid will let us know. i’m quite particular about perfumes- we like what we like! but this beauty ‘belle chérie’ is gorgeous! i’m wearing it today! from the famous @fragonardparfumeurofficiel in paris! top mandarin, star fruit, cinnamon heart jasmine, heliotrope, lily of the valley base sandalwood, tonka bean, vanilla have a lovely day one day you will look back and see that all along you were blooming. @worshipblog everything is working out for the greater good. sometimes it’s so hard to see that light, when you’re going through it. but hear me, seeds are planted in darkness gradually break through the soil begin to bloom. so find comfort in knowing that most of what we face is not in vain. there’s always a higher purpose. what are you wearing on 21st june?? it will not be gym stuff had to add that after yesterday’s announcement last week i saw a lot of posts around exercise and ‘how to get results’ and this led to today’s post.. exercise myths unused muscle turns to fat no. muscle tissue has muscle cells. fat tissue has fat cells. they can’t magically turn into each other... not possible! training abs will get you abs! nooppeeee. it will certainly strengthen your core but it will not get you abs. you will have to get rid of the layer of fat.. calorie deficit, weight lifting and a little cardio mixed in sweat burns fat sorry to say.. nooo! yes we get hot and sweaty during a hard sesh!! but sweat is the body’s way of cooling your core temperature down... sweat is just water, yes it comes with the hard work but it’s the hard work burning the cals and fat not the water leaving your body cardio burns fat guess what?.. no cardio burns calories.. and actually too much cardio alone. can be bad for you!! only doing cardio and no form of resistance training can lead to burning muscle tissue and can slow down your metabolism! muscle weighs more than fat nah. 1kg of muscle and 1kg of fat is still 1kg! muscle is more dense than fat... in terms of muscle gain you can add weight on the scales but long term the increase in muscle causes an increase in resting cals burned day muscle gain long term sustainable benefits and better physical shape we woke up to sun but it’s decided to hide again oh well, nice while it lasted!

by tiffany onyejiaka on the healthline website and see for yourself. with that being said, with yesterday's reel in mind and today's post please remember to wear your spf. i have been trying the black girl sunscreen which i purchased from @richskxn and so far i am loving it! no white cast whatsoever and it's incredibly moisturising. easter cone filled with strawberry milkshake, mini eggs not suitable for children under 4 so can change the sweets if needed and marshmallows. only £1.50 a cone. dm me to order! wild child what a beautiful day for walk, this weather has really had a positive impact on me the last couple of days. there are brighter day's ahead. we love this walk at the ladybelt county park, logan even found a den someone had built. i would recommend it for anyone local or for a walk once the restrictions are lifted easter sweet cone with a mix of chocolate, jellies and marshmallows only £1.50 a cone dm me to order! title: the day dream artist: dante gabriel rossetti year: 1880 medium: oil on canvas style: pre-raphaelite ʎɐpsǝn⊥ uoıʇɐɯɹoɟsuɐɹ⊥ we’re getting ready to go nowhere!!

𝐈 𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫. fast forward years later, i don't need to shout this to the world. it is very apparent that people care about me, and really, that's probably one of the best bday gifts of all- to know that i am loved especially by mike!!! life is not perfect. you're meant to take the good with the bad, and the bad makes the good seem even better. but if you feel like you're missing something in your life, fill in the gaps yourself. it may take a long time but you'll get there. thanks for all the bday wishes!!! line illustrations from your photographs a simple way to turn those precious memories into stylish prints and gifts. from £15 click the link in my bio to shop. my little family i have wanted to be a mum for such a long time. there are times when it’s really tough, but mostly it just feels amazing. when i was pregnant, i was so worried that i wouldn’t bond with zac, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. i love him with everything i have i was worried that i wouldn’t know what to do with him, or how i would cope when he cries spoiler alert, i don’t cope well when he cries at all, i just do everything i possibly can to stop it and fortunately it doesn’t take much!, but you just get to know your baby. you know when they’re tired or hungry, or just having a little grump. mamas and mamas-to-be, you’ve got this. we’ve got this, and for when things are tough and you’re doubting yourself, my inbox is always open thank you @inspiredarcher for your support, for making things so much easier for us and for making me life complete also, we were wearing matching tops but zac pooped all over his the weather gives me those summer time vibes 5k happy birthday to me!!! a weekend of big walks and lovely food. my mum dropped me off a carrot cake with walnuts and pecans, and alex’s mum dropped off a beetroot and feta galette! we also had an amaaaaazing curry from @motudelivery paneer tikka masala, vegetable samosas, daal, and plenty of rice and naan. not to mention all the prosecco. today will involve the biggest birthday breakfast known to mankind... can’t wait! here's one for those of you who aren't feeling positive rn, who feel anxious and worried still. after yesterday's lockdown update, i have seen so much positivity on my feed and its wonderful to see. but here's one for those of you who don't feel excited yet. it's ok if you're worried about what the rest of the year has to come, it's ok if you don't feel confident seeing lots of people again and it's ok if you don't want to get excited about going to a beer garden. for me, i'm struggling with the idea of having 'normality' back. since the first lockdown, i have finished university, had a baby, moved house and lost my mum. i don't have my old normal anymore, i can't go back to how things were before covid, and that really scares me. of course, it's important to remember that better days are coming soon, and that you will feel excited about that eventually, but if right now you're not, don't beat yourself up about it. everyone feels things differently, and if you're friend is excited about hopping on a plane to greece as soon as possible, and you want to stay in your dressing gown at home for as long as possible, both of those feelings are valid. be kind to yourself, and be kind to others, we have been through a lot together week: day 2 today’s stylist is my curious and genuinely hilarious niece, clara. she loves figure out how things work. she also loves all things sparkly... that’s why when i asked her what she thought i should wear, i ended up in an explosion of pink twinkles. so much variety to be found in the wye valley, just imagining myself wandering in a cloud forest high in the mountains of costa rica during this walk www.nailahsaccessories.com [review] @clearstart micro-pore mist what’s interesting about the packaging is that every micro-pore mist bottle is unique on its own way. why?

[pr] let's talk physical exfoliation! no—physical exfoliator is not the worst thing on earth.. unless it's st. ives apricot scrub. jk jk physical exfoliation is the manual sloughing off of dead skin to reveal smoother and 'polished' skin overtime so don't expect to immediately have clear skin because you can't just scrub your acne away!! this method of exfoliating can easily be overdone, especially if you're using an abrasive exfoliator e.g. nut shells. peeling gels are on the gentler side of physical exfoliants. once you massage the gel on your skin, the formula will start balling up to act as the grains that will exfoliate your skin. those grains are not to be confused with your dead skin! this @dearmay.official 𝗚𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗻 𝗟𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗹 𝗦𝗼𝗳𝘁 𝗣𝗲𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗚𝗲𝗹 is a product i've particularly found to be effective in making my skin as soft as a baby's bum!! it's not very abrasive and 'scratchy' feeling on the skin and no rednessirritation after using it either so that's a good sign. it does have a minty feeling after rinsing which i'm guessing is from the tea tree in it. overall, i have no complaints with this peeling gel. it does what it's supposed to do and comes at an affordable price php 349.00$7.19 you can get this locally at @suisuiph! loving the cold weather we've been experiencing lately here in finally i can wear cozy clothes and thick blankets. my cat, bacon, has been sleeping all day! before i hit the sack, here's a review on one of the products i've been enjoying. [pr] @isntree spot saver mugwort ampoule soothes sensitive skin quickly, strengthens skin barrier, and delivers nutrition for clearer and healthier skin. they applied time drop method wherein mugwort is extracted drop by drop. this ensures that only effective ingredients are extracted. 𝐓𝐋𝐃𝐑; lightweight texture classy glass bottle no essential oil, alcohol, and fragrance soothes skin effectively provides little hydration 𝐍𝐨𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐫𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬: 85 mugwort extract from ganghwa, licorice extract, calendula extract, piper methysticum extract kava-kava soothing, panthenol, beta-glucan, lecithin skin-replenishing, ceramide 𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞: i love the gradient on glass packaging! i dropped it accidentally and thankful that it didn't break! 5 points for packaging! so the ampoule has pale brown color and little viscosity to it almost watery. sinks right into the skin like it ain't got time for any bs. it doesn't leave any tacky finish which is lovely. you can add another layer if you want to, but one layer is actually enough. it's easy to incorporate in routine. green tea fresh toner and this ampoule really helped a lot in calming the irritated part of my right cheek. after 3 days, redness was significantly reduced. seriously. i find this reliable because it acts so quick. without it, that irritation might still be present and this review's still in draft. the cause? i might have gone overboard on acne-fighting skincare products never a good idea. while it does what it claims to do, i feel that this may be on a pricier side. i love soothing products and yes, this one belongs in that department. superb mugwort performance on this one! texture 5, packaging 5, scent 5, performance 5, price 4 rating: 4.85 $37.80 50ml pao 6m we are sold out of our ‘carla’ mocha wrap front cardigan! restock due in later this week girls will let you know when this is live again love a homemade knit by nanna dreaming of creamy spring knits swoon this beautiful faux leather would make a perfect addition to your large enough to carry all of your and makeup, it's not only gorgeous but functional. the side panels compliment the rose perfectly. available for purchase on my website and 100 this beautiful faux leather would make a perfect addition to your large enough to carry all of your and makeup, it's not only gorgeous but functional. the side panels compliment the rose perfectly. available for purchase on my website and 100 this beautiful faux leather would make a perfect addition to your large enough to carry all of your and makeup, it's not only gorgeous but functional. the side panels compliment the rose perfectly. available for purchase on my website and 100 how comes no one gossips about how much you helped them? @yeswalz follow @flexoffendersclub @offwhite @virgilabloh @celine @ysl this content does not belong to us, no copyright infringement is intended by use of this media a change is as good as a rest new name alert! i figured it was time for a bit of a change to my online life. naggins and notions was a bit of craic and definitely got me recognised at events but it wasn’t me! to keep a very long story short, the daly dilemma is me! i’ll have a post up on my brand new shiny website in the next week giving you more info on the name change and why i chose the daly dilemma! can you guess the product from today's it's @thebodyshop british rose petal soft gel toner! recently i've been making an effort to shop my stash and use up the products i have, rather than buying more. i remember picking this up last year with my birthday voucher after seeing that it was supposedly a dupe for the fresh rose deep hydration facial toner. this toner is aimed at dry, dehydrated skin types and claims to replump skin with moisture, leaving it feeling soft, smooth and replenished. it two key ingredients are rose extract and aloe vera. this toner has a gel consistency, which i find is better applied by hand, rather than on a cotton pad. it has a lovely cooling and soothing effect on application, and a few drops is enough for the whole face. it does feel a little tacky on the skin after applying, but this goes away after a few minutes and leaves my skin feeling really soft and hydrated. overall, i do like this toner. it's different to my usual watery hydrating toners and adds a little touch of luxury to my routine. i have a feeling this one will last me a while, as a little definitely goes a long way with this product. i'd love to know your thoughts if you've tried this toner, or other rose products in general! updated well, for one of my bookshelves my office bookshelf has grown so much in the past few months... which means my tbr pile is now out of control! who can relate?! qotd: any favorites on this shelf? do you organize your shelves by colors? some goodies for @drunkelephant dbronzi sunshine drops. i fell for the hype a couple years back when this came out. you mix it with spf, serums, or foundations for a bronzed look. it’s an extra step that i don’t need. i can bronze with my bronzers @oxygenetix acne control foundation with salicylic acid. i bought this after watching one of those vogue youtube videos where a celeb used this. i regret it i used their color matching system and this is too dark for me. so i mix it with a lighter concealer or foundation. it looks like any other foundation on my face and i don’t notice an improvement in my skin. @emcosmetics serum blush in venetian rose. i’ve made multiple posts about how i like the serum finish but that the dropper sucks what are some products that disappointed you? meet the family part 5 i think. this is alan unfortunately was given to us as a boy hence the name but is actually the littlest girl. she got to about 5 months and didn’t grow anymore. she has a strange obsession with the en-suite and doesn’t really like boys. another reason odd alan fact is that the day we picked her up our friend also picked her sister without knowing so we still know her sister mabel scent of the day rosy crush givenchy i love anything with rose in it and since the weather is warming up i decided to go for a nice springtime fragrance. rosy crush is exactly what it says on the bottle. it smells like a blast of a fresh bouquet of roses. super fresh and sweet. after it dries down you can start to pick up on the musk and maybe the tiniest bit spicy maybe it’s the pepper. great combination of rose, vanilla and patchouli. it’s a super likeable springsummer scent. longevity is not amazing but its not terrible. got on sale so i’m not mad about it. m e n u s is anyone else stuck when it comes to keeping meal times fun and keeping the junk food out?

this would be an ideal writing spot who else has tried this peeling solution from the ordinary? do you love it or hate it? @deciem using leftovers to celebrate once more. we love a takeaway in our house, but there’s something about that is sooooo satisfying. it may be the process of preparing the ingredients, time spent with my daughters explaining cooking method or why we use a instead of another. i had some that needed using and what a better way of a quick lunch ready in 40 minutes from start to finish?!? i love the use of for the filling which used wisely, will match the sweetness of the shrimp beautifully. the skin is made of only 3 ingredients that everyone would have in their kitchens. firstly panfried in hot sesame oil and then steamed, in italian we say uno tira l’altro one leads to another and before you know it they are all gone! get my full recipe on my @cookpaduk profile! unpopular opinion: white pants are meant to be worn year round. do you still think wearing white pants before memorial day is a faux pas?

i know, i am a pasta snob, but if you’re going to make pasta, please leave feta out of it. or just make a gorgeous ‘lil one-pan roast chicken and if you’re feeling fancy, platter it up like you’re at a charming french bistro instead of at your dining table for the 400th night in a row. è voila! our ‘nova’ pu biker leggings are a wardrobe essential for all your post-lockdown adventures super slimming with lots of leverage. more colours coming soon! rrp £24.99 get yours from us for only £16.99 we price check daily so we can make sure we’re giving you the best prices every time www.beautsbrand.co.uk here is cheatsheet for how often to use @clairelegacyart here at spritzbyrosey @fmworldofficial we pride ourselves on doing our bit for the planet and the well-being of the world, we are a brand that is entirely against the testing and inhumane treatment of animals and we have a very wide range of 100 vegan products, to ensure we are able to provide for each and every single one of our customers needs!🪴 if you’d like more information about our vegan fragrances! don’t be shy and ask me for our full scent list i also provide full lists of ingredients for those who have allergies for others who would just like to know! light and shadow adds another layer to this portrait of queen katherine of aragon. a biro and pencil drawing. walks and getting take away coffee is the only thing keeping me going atm had to memorialize my first successful twist out of 2021. here’s hoping my hair continues to act right hey! meet hazel or @hazecr she loves art and drawing. homebody all the way and she enjoys the occasional night out. also loves traveling and her sleep. she loves fashion as a means of expression, and her current favorite aesthetic is the 90s! attention!! new scent added to waxmelts candles collection! lady million literally smells amazing!. attention!! new scent added to waxmelts candles collection! lady million literally smells amazing!. i’m thriving while they are catching up from @thevegankind ️@mydandies which i want to make crispy bites with. need to find for it. any suggestions?

spring is in the air and in my step and definitely in my outfit. it is tuesday reviews day and today i have a good product for you all...... for those of you struggling with hair growth, @curlsmithofficial scalp booster is for you. this booster is a daily leave-in scalp serum to help create the optimal environment for hair follicles. it encourages hair growth and a healthy scalp. when you apply it, it feels kind of soapy and a little goes a long way but then it dries up pretty quickly and does not leave your scalp feeling greasy. this little bottle is $27 usd. i wish i can say this post is sponsored but it’s not lol overall, i’d say i recommend this product, the only downside is the cost but so far it’s been working out for me and i can honestly say i feel like my hair looks a little more fuller after using it. have you tried this product before?? @curlsmithofficial @curlsmithofficial i love letters receiving them, keeping them and reading those of others. i also love books of actual letters including allan ahlberg's fabulous childrens' book the jolly postman, or other people's letters. today i got out a copy of john keats' letter to his girlfriend fanny brawne it's a bit scary in places but totally befitting an earnest romantic poet. no my sweet i do not want you to be unhappy and yet i do it's the bicentary of john keats' death today and rome is where it's at he's buried in the protestant cemetery there and the keats-shelley museum is on piazza di spagna keats journeyed to italy in the hope of recovering from tuberculosis, but died there at the age of 25. bob geldof narrates from keats' letters go to ksh.roma.it and there are lots of other events happening throughout the day. for more visit thegloss.ie. have you got a favourite keats poem?

or is there anything that’s stopping you from starting? i’m here to help you start your journey! @wildkindphotography when your pal invents using poo bags to keep your ears warm on your dog walk!! @chrissysmakeupandbeauty @xchrissykx when your pal invents using poo bags to keep your ears warm on your dog walk!! @chrissysmakeupandbeauty @xchrissykx ahhhhh, this pink, it’s like making a statement without saying a word!!! happy tuesday!!!!! just wishing you all a wonderful day!!! have a wonderful week everyone!!! dress and coat: made by me ahhhhh, this pink, it’s like making a statement without saying a word!!! happy tuesday!!!!! just wishing you all a wonderful day!!! have a wonderful week everyone!!! dress and coat: made by me ahhhhh, this pink, it’s like making a statement without saying a word!!! happy tuesday!!!!! just wishing you all a wonderful day!!! have a wonderful week everyone!!! dress and coat: made by me 𝘌𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘺𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘩𝘢𝘴 𝘪𝘵𝘴 𝘰𝘸𝘯 𝘣𝘦𝘢𝘶𝘵𝘺 brains two of our gorgeous limited edition organic cotton kids jumpers off to a new home there's still some available to be made to order in kids sizes only 0-12y www.altern8ego.com another one of my treats from me to me very simular to the ysl luxurious false lash mascara but a fraction of the price! i'm so in love with it. such a pretty packaging and really good on my lashes. love it abs workout here are 3 of my favourite exercises to focus on the abdominals, this workout is pretty advanced so you may need to adjust the reps. full workout: ab wheel 4 sets 10-15 reps weighted planks 4 sets 40-60 seconds weighted v-ups 4 sets 10 reps whoever has my voodoo doll...can you give her a blow dry?

you can save this so you can read it back later. every time i board a new client for branding, i always ask what is their purpose and what they think is their brand is important. times are changing. when choosing brands to do business with, today’s consumers care about more than just what products or services they offer—they care about what kind of impact brands are making in the world. and if you want to take your brand to the next level, you need a sense of purpose—a sense of purpose your audience truly connects to. your brand purpose can have a major impact on how your brand is viewed in the market—and, ultimately, can be the driving force behind your success but what, exactly, is the brand's purpose? why is it so important? and how can you define, build, and market a brand purpose that feels true to who you are—and forges a real connection with your ideal customers in the process? brand purpose represents your reason for being and what you stand for above all else. knowing your brand purpose is one thing—but getting it out into the world is another. your brand should be viewed as important because it shows your customers that you’re not just your products, services, or advertising campaigns. you have a purpose—and it’s bigger than just turning a profit. having a clearly defined brand purpose is what keeps you going when things inevitably get hard. it gives a deeper sense of meaning to everything you do and makes the day-to-day challenges of running a business worth it. trying to forcefully introduction spring into my life as i'm sick of winter i can't wait for the warm sunshine, nice walks and picnics in the park, flowers all over the city blooming again big up cardiff for having daffodils everywhere! and mostly just to not always feel like the sky is grey and sad 23.02.1995. tracksuit @hm bag @greyandblush trainer @veja @gillianloves @lifeinthefashlane @motherhoodstyled @katieluise @genuinelygeorgia @hm @thecarlyedit @whatelliewears @natalie.mafi @mummasootd @leopardprintandlipstick @monicavinader @veja @nichelamaria classy sassy 23.02.2021 one month of ralph. or ralphie or mr ralph as he’s been nicknamed. made in the first lockdown, born in the third, and as a result we’ve spent our first month mostly in our living room at home. only 118 more days until i can show you off properly to the world my boy. “açaí drip” some drip drop and reverse for i’m having 2 tests today so won’t get on here too much have a nice day y’all @fourthraybeauty açaí face milk “açaí drip” some drip drop and reverse for i’m having 2 tests today so won’t get on here too much have a nice day y’all @fourthraybeauty açaí face milk winter walk behind every bad bitch, is a car seat did you know that 2.3 million american women have voluntarily left the workforce since february of 2020? female participation in the workforce is the lowest it’s been since 1988. one of the main reasons women cited leaving their job? childcare needs. y’all childcare is expensive for many families, it just doesn’t make sense for both parents to work outside the home. more often than not, it’s the woman who puts her career aspirations on hold. so listen up: if your very real, insanely difficult, immensely demanding, extremely important job title is stay-at-home-mom, but you kinda sorta want to be making your own money and flexing your professional muscles every now and then, direct sales is a good fit for you. you get to be home with your kids⁣ you’re in charge of your schedule you make money sounds like a no-brainer, don’t ya think?

me too! seriously tho, am remaining suspicious it will actually happen bc if you never get your hopes up you can never be disappointed and also this whole last year has made me a real bitter betty aaaaaaaaanyway, so how on god's green earth are you supposed to make a goulash look good? seriously, if anybody has any suggestions i will gratefully receive them. kinda wanting to really bask in stews and soups now while it's still cold and grey ok, so it looks like it was pre-chewed, i'll accept that. but was it delicious? fuck yeah it was! it's a delicious mix of beef, peppers, paprika, caraway seeds which simply do not get enough love, onions, celery, carrots, tomatoes, bay leaves, potatoes and 'snips, which is what i call parsnips bc i'm annoying. a biiiiiig heap of sour cream and a drizzle of sweet chilli sauce makes all stews and hashes better, honestly. the tan glow f o l l o w @gvldngrls this is going to be another weird summer cover the earth before it covers you @rasyte11 is amazingly fit and beautiful babe from toronto.. follow her blog to see how a fit life looks like. here comes the sun.. new in! oversized rib hoodie and skinny fit joggers made entirely from recycled material. ultimate wardrobe essentials which are made ethically in the uk tap to shop or order online www.wastetowaist.com mini black sesame cookies i am a huge black sesame fan. i pretty much will choose it over any other option on a menu. i've been watching @avaqyeats make a bunch of black sesame dishes for a while now, envious of her black sesame paste stash. so when i finally found black sesame, i literally bought 3 packs cuz i know i will be making a ton of recipes with it from here on out. these mini cookies were so easy to make. i think the hardest part was probably just measuring everything out and cutting it. it only takes 10-12 minutes in the oven and you are in sesame heaven. feel free to add a sprinkle or two of white sesame on top, push them down a little, for decorative purposes. you don't have to. don't fret if you do not have black sesame paste. you can also make it yourself. or if worse comes to worse, you can always omit it the colour and flavour might not be as strong, but it should still taste good! enjoy! [swipe right for recipe} yesterday i got a couple pieces of bad news. both took me by surprise and i was initially very disappointed and upset. to be honest i’m still upset today. but, rather than wallow in my disappointment i’m moving forward with new plans. the news actually gave me clarity that there are other options and yet again reminded me to be flexible and open. when one door closes another opens. easier said than done, but life is a practice in growing and changing.⁣ photo @mybrandphotographer @thenaturalcardcompany chingford, united kingdom new home pearly eyes it was hard to capture the color but this shadow is a beautiful mint green with gold reflects??? i’m obsessed and this will be a perfect spring color i used: brow gel and pencil in black x eyeshadow in glacier random dollar store pearls with lash princess mascara enrich your with the @paulaschoice enriched calming toner 𝐂𝐥𝐚𝐢𝐦: this hydrating toner recovers moisture loss and soothes dry and flaky skin. it is infused with antioxidants such as vitamin e and primrose to revitalise and nourish while also protecting the skin from environmental stressors. 𝐑𝐞𝐯𝐢𝐞𝐰: the toner is free from perfume and drying alcohols, which is a big plus. although the website states that it is very gentle and suitable for skin prone to eczema, i still felt that i was missing some hydration. also my skin became more red after using it… 𝐑𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: for people with a dry skin, i would definitely recommend a toner that offers more hydration. pc’s formula might be too strong for us after all... the toner from @drjetskeultee is a good option. a more budget friendly option would be the toner from @neutralnl for people with normal to oily skin, however, this toner might be a great option have you ever tried toners from @paulaschoice 𝗔𝗳𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗼𝗼𝗻 𝗟𝘂𝗻𝗰𝗵𝗕𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗸𝗳𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝗜𝗱𝗲𝗮 scrambled eggs acocado on toast 3 large eggs 2 slices wholemeal bread 12 avocado 12 mild chilli 12 lemon juice salt pepper calories: 560 carbs: 50g pro: 29g fat: 27g simple, quick delicious product: @colleenrothschild jumbo radiant cleansing balm $95, but i got it for $66.50 after discount⠀ why it’s a pick: this product is a great example of why i love this community so much. i’d never heard of this brand, but i saw a post from @my.sister.made.me.buy.it raving about it and since i was in need of a new cleansing balm, i took the plunge. and now i have a new favorite in my routine. the advice she gave was to use this balm paired with a muslin cleansing cloth 1 is included, but you’ll likely want more on hand and i’ll echo that. it’s nice and luxe, but it leaves behind no residue. a little goes a long way, so i anticipate this lasting me almost a year. that helps me justify the price too: other cleansing balms are between $20-35 and i’d use several in a year, so this isn’t any higher of a price in the long run. have you tried this brand yet? here have this while i work on a thing sorry i've been a bit quiet, saturday i was working, sunday i was sulking that we can't go anywhere and sleeping and monday was a roller coaster of emotions! after being in a really low mood sunday i recieved a letter monday morning after our walk informing me i was high risk and had to shield. i'm not going to lie to you, it tipped me over the edge. after sobbing and having a bit of a panic attack to my bossfriendsecond mum on the phone, annoying my hubby while he was busy at work and confusing the children as to why mummy just kept saying no and this is bullshit i did eventually chill out to get to the bottom of it. turns out they had me down as being diabetic, but i actually just experienced gestational diabetes when pregnant with nathan and was found not to have it after he was born. i explained this to the drs and they've fixed it and i do not have to shield. apparently this mistake has been made a lot so might be the case if you get one through! don't get me wrong i totally understand why people do have to shield and i would have done it if i absolutely had to but... 1 i was pretty damn sure i wasn't vulnerable well not physically anyway and 2 on top of everything and the meltdowns i've had with my anxiety the thought of another 5 weeks stuck inside with not even my one shift a week i've still been able to do while the kids are off was just more than i could take at that moment. oh and i also was waiting on a visit from aunt flo and she wasn't showing up which was making me extra anxious panic over though! beyond happy and relieved the kids are back on 8th march! i'm hopeful things are going to start getting better and we can start making happier memories again ps taken the advice from one of my lovely friends today and chilling out with a cup of tea. and cake, because everything is better with cake. hoodie and t-shirts available now at www.ecostoresonline.com use promo code: bhm21 for 20 off. featuring @skyy.highhh and @educharlie @blkmario spring vibes who’s excited for warmer weather and hopefully a lockdown free summer?!?!

f o l l o w @gvldngrls pondicherry has been on my travel bucket list for so long that i don’t even remember! from the colourful facades to the clean beaches to the mixed culture and food! travelled after almost a year and safe to say, every minute of the trip was thoroughly enjoyed. back home, in self quarantine catching up on everything i missed these 4 days! got all wrapped up, took two steps outside the door and determined getting my steps in wasn’t worth getting wind burn and drenched hands up everyone who's got their nail appointment booked for 12th april @helenewerstaylor @ootdbymarjolein.nl @overbutnotout @tracysfashionstyle @styleyounew @whothefrockisalice swipe through literally woke up like this. this is today’s texture tuesday post featuring my “freckled” skin. i wanted to embrace my skin, even in its current condition. my skin texture has started to improve again thanks to my consistent skincare routine. maskne has really caused my skin especially around my cheek area to breakout, and leaving back dark spots. and i’ve always had an uneven skintone peep the dark eye bags, nah i would drop it, but imma wait for it to be more consistent before i can give you my official routine. until then, here are my key tips for building your own routine: -learn your skin. not every method you see on instagram will work for you. skincare isn’t a one-size-fits all. i discovered my skin is normaldry drier around the winter time. find what works for you within your budget. if you can splurge without going broke, go for it. but also, there are some great products out that are super inexpensive. and there are alternatives for the pricey products all the time. there is no need to follow skincare trends. test them out at your own pace. skincare products will always be around. i learned this once i realized how much money i spent on products not that i was hoping on the bandwagon often. not everyone can afford the newest serum that drops in sephora. shucks, targét target if you wanna be fancy has some great gems. also, regarding skincare trends, please use what works for you. don’t let other opinions hinder things for you. so example, i know imma get back lashed for saying this and idgaf but if that st. ives scrub or another physical scrub works for you as long as you aren’t ripping your skin apart then use it. people really be getting into their feelings when others use what works for them. i might not like what you like, and vice versa, but that’s the beauty about the skincare world. and i said what i’ve said hope this helps my comfortable uniform these days. please bring your own cup for taking away coffee or cup. every time i see someone post with a single-use cup. i just want to leave a comment to bring with own cup. anyone else? who said you can’t? matter of fact, forget them because you can beautiful and don’t ever forget it!hope you’re having a wonderful day! who said you can’t? matter of fact, forget them because you can beautiful and don’t ever forget it!hope you’re having a wonderful day! we love this colorful option! this bracelet has black, gold, green, pink beads in rows. it's delicate enough to be a subtle addition to any outfit or any bracelet stack. alexa play “walking away” by craig david sneaks: @stevemadden jeans: @currentelliott top: @targetstyle sunnies: @arm.yanski dolabımda o kadar renkli kıyafet varken hep simşiyah giyiniyorum bu aralar i have soo many colourful clothes in my wardrobe but wearing all black these days for some reason spring is in the air sitting pretty wearing our ‘rosa’ blush velour tracksuit one of our absolute faves only £29.99 ladies the sailor style is always perfect for the spring season. spring in on the way and so the breton stripes i'm a huge fan and you?

do you know what is this for?⁣ it is a cream base product, with very high pigment content and thick consistency.⁣ it is not a foundation but you can use it as such.⁣ it is not a concealer but makes wonders on the undereye and on any spot you want to cover.⁣ it is not an eyeshadow base but cancels out any discoloration and veins.⁣ it is a multitasker! you will need time to get to know each other slowly. but when you master this product you don't want to be without, i swear you.⁣ do you have any question about this product?

available in any concepts and a custom requests as well. @spotmyhouse tuesday in the office attire it's national holiday, so actually we are not supposed to work today. and i was seriously considering wear my sweatpants instead of jeans, but decided this would be too informal... wondering how many of my future posts will be labelled outfit inspo for 2106 and beyond jumpsuit boots @asos @asoslovescurve belt @boohoo tuesday morning tea time 22.02.2021 i was born like this, don’t even gotta try i was born like this, don’t even gotta try mentally we’re here m o m e n t s nothing quite like scrolling through my photos and thinking back to some great moments really looking forward to summer or atleast the sun! btw. took me awhile to go through my photos since i have 54 235 photos and videos on my phone do you dare to look how many you have?? mexican bean wraps! one of my favourite things to eat! here i had mine with salsa in the bowl, @inagarten sweetcorn and avocado salad and some guacamole! all of it homemade of course!! hope everyone is having a good week so far! layla lash really does it for me she perfects even an everyday look doughnuts were the winner!! so using what i had in the cupboard made these. strawberry jam, white chocolate marshmallow custard, and plain sugared doughnut. they were not as light as could of been, will tweak recipe with a little more yeast for the flour i used! great tasting and sure to be done again with different fillings.... standby smoothie for me; latte for j. i love this local organic cafe @cloveberry be patient with yourself. nothing in nature blooms all year. ever look at your kids and think when did you get so big?? urgh perfect outfit for a nice stroll in the park you can see i put it some effort to be similar in the first photo top, skirt: @uniqlo shoes: @toms purse: @katespadeny see the light in others, and treat them as if it’s all you see yesterday called for a glass of wine. i felt like i was on the receiving end of a lot of misplaced anger and frustration from others. thinking through it when i got home, i kept coming back to the quote above it’s been one of my absolute favorites since sophomore year of college. everyone has bad days, everyone gets angry, and sometimes you get the wrong end of that stick. and while obviously in a perfect world people wouldn’t let that boil over and it wouldn’t come out to those who don’t deserve it, guess what, they do. that doesn’t define them. just like someone’s past doesn’t define them either. it’s so easy to see the bad, remember the bad, associate someone with the bad. but if you treat a dog like a cat, it will think it’s a cat. if you treat someone like all you see is their darkness, soon the darkness will be all they can see in themselves as well. see the light in others, and treat them as if that’s all you see. see the good in people. perhaps it makes me naive, and i’ve been burned before and i’ll be burned again, but it’s a much better life when i look around and see the light than when you paint your world in darkness. when i focus on the light in everyone around me, it not only helps them see it but it makes my world brighter as well! if your monday ended up a little like mine, try taking this mindset into the rest of your week, i promise you’ll be amazed at what you get back. “to the girl that lives in the flowers: never stop creating your own worlds. e.e. floating on pink today with herbivore pink cloud creamy jelly cleanser. this cleanser contains rose hydrosol, tremella mushroom and sqalane. it’s supposed to gently cleanse while calming skin, reducing redness and moisturizing. it has a gentle jelly texture that doesn't lather heavily but gets the job done without stripping the skin. the rose scent which i’m not the biggest fan of is very faint and disappears quickly. for 24$ it comes in a 100ml glass bottle that feels super nice and luxurious. what’s your favorite gentle cleanser?

one day this is going to be over can you imagine that day? how we’ll come out into the sun and laugh hug, and sing dance, and hold hands? i’m living for that day. it’ll be like nothing we’ve ever experienced before. but until then mamas, keep your heads up high. do the best that you can make every single moment count. we might be physically alone, but we are definitely much stronger than we think as we are in this together sofa we do love a comfy sofa, but didn't want anything too bulky in our home. when we found this sleek mid-century style sofa, which is also incredibly comfortable, we knew it was the perfect fit this jacket is my new obsession, i can’t stop wearing it new blog post link in bio: booking fire pits at the santa cruz beach boardwalk! on the weekend, we booked one of the private fire pits at the @beachboardwalk in santa cruz, california to celebrate my daughter's birthday. we had socially-distanced fenced off space, our own fire pit right next to the sand and we added on some s'mores supplies. we also lucked out with some epic february weather not too windy, moderate temp and, most importantly, no rain! this is a new add at our local boardwalk have you had local places get creative with offerings to help entice visitors to come back?

any staples? @fredaria the goal is to always be better than the last time. that can be mentally, physically or both!! i strived for so long to be the smallest version of me, instead of being a happier version of me. not every day is going to be perfect, and there’s going to be days where you will fail and have to put your ego aside to grow and become better. even if you’re still working out at home, or your circumstances keep you from entering a gym, don’t let the surrounding elements affect you from accomplishing any goals. even if it’s just to be happier, your situation can have two very different outcomes depending on how you look at it. for me, there was a day where i hit rock bottom mentally. i was drained in all aspects and i knew i needed to put my ego aside, and do things the right way to see progress and change. and with that came a healthier, happier gaby. always choose happiness, and always strive to be better than the last time. high neck crop tops f o l l o w @gvldngrls golden hour i was finally able to go get my nails done! personally, getting my nails done is something i like and that i do for me! et toi, what do you do for you? cloudy but paradise winter lunch checked out @tempuramatsui which serves the best tempura in the city i tried their seafood and veggie tempura lunch set and i loved every part of it! will be back for more i often hear clients say, “i just want someone to love me.” “why doesn’t anyone love me?” to this i just say, “what if that someone was you?” “what stops you from showing up for yourself the way you want someone else to show up for you?” i’ve found that when we become more comfortable with showing others as well as ourselves love, it shows others that we are open to receiving love. people that struggle with loving themselves also struggle to feel loved by others or it becomes so addictive, they settle for less than what they need. if this is you, you settle for what you can get because you feel it’s what you deserve. believe me, you deserve soooo much more than you can even imagine. we show others how to love us through our words and actions. so when we allow someone to continually hurt us, we teach them that this is within our boundaries of acceptable love. do not keep giving all your love and affection to people if you are going to also allow them to treat you badly. when you allow others to treat you with disrespect, it’s another way of not loving yourself. they will not change unless they want to and they don’t. you have to advocate for yourself. you have to love yourself more than anyone else. you have to love yourself so much that you are willing to risk people leaving when you stand up for yourself and your needs. repeat after me, “i only accept people that respect me into my life.” the other component of this is to also love others. show up for others the way you are learning to show up for yourself. allow others to show up for you. a fun exercise: ask your friends what their love languages are! start showing them love the way they wish to receive love! tell me your love languages in the comments it’s tuesday! i’m tired, spotty and hormonal. i’ve not been able to do upper body sessions because of my bicep pain and i’m now eating rest day calories on those days which now means i’m resting 5 days a week i want to eat the world and watch netflix in bed but you know what?

she is who she think she is captured by the greatest @focalizemedia have i been watching too much @historyvikings possibly did i feel cute and don't really care about people options on my tv consumption? definitely empty 35: lancome advanced genifique face serum i seem to be gravitating towards the expensive serums in my collection recently not entirely sure why, but i think this is the last high-end serum i had in my collection. this is the lancome advanced genifique serum, and i got this from ulta as my birthday gift last year. i've finally used it up, so i'm now able to share my thoughts. for context, i have dry skin overall, and am prone to both acne and eczema. this is an anti-aging serum formulated by lancome intended to help target the key signs of visible aging. anti-aging is one of those terms that means a lot and yet nothing at all, so looking into it, this is a prebiotic serum that also contains vitamin c and humectants to help target wrinkles and hydration. the idea behind prebiotics in skincare is that they can help balance the skin's microbiome, which in terms helps the health of the skin. this also contains ascorbyl glucoside, which is a more stable form of vitamin c, a potent antioxidant. we also have humectants like glycerin and sodium hyaluronate to help round out the formula. this formula does contain added fragrance, so if that's an issue for you, keep that in mind. overall, i thought this formula was just ok. i got about three weeks of use out of this small bottle, so a little bit went a long way for me, and i did notice a decrease in some fine lines and a little more glow to my skin. i also didn't experience irritation from this product, which i was pleasantly surprised by. however, i didn't notice much hydration from this serum, which is an issue for me given my skin dryness. i need my serums to provide the hydration that my skin lacks, and that goes doubly so in winter, and this did not do that. overall, i think this would work a lot better for someone with more normal skin, but this wasn't a hit for me, especially given the price. not bad, just not for me. 35, would not repurchase. product cost, $21.06, yearly running total: $529.63 swipe left to see the swatch for some inexplicable reason, the most valued part of my makeup collection is blush. i literally cannot control myself when it comes to blush formulas. @rarebeauty melting blush in “nearly mauve” is my recent pleasant surprise, because it was an impulse buy, which is almost never successful🥲 it’s buildable, it stays on all day, it feels like almost skincare, it doesn’t make you greasy. more importantly, this shade “nearly mauve”, looks berry toned on my cool toned skin, which i really appreciate. i am a fan of cool toned blushes. without a doubt, @rarebeauty is what’s your favorite part of makeup? some of my favourite @morphebrushes palettes summer really is within touching distance.... i’m not usually one for wishing away the days but i’m sure i’m not the only one longing for summer evenings in the garden with wine confit tomatoes in my last post, i asked what i should confit next and well, tomatoes was what i landed on! these are so delicious and rich in flavour. almost more so than the slow roasted ones i did a few weeks back! i tried a different method with my confit this time too, slowly cooking the tomatoes in oil in the oven at a low temp for around an hour and a half as opposed to on the hob. the result?! sweet, rich tomatoes that really level up your sandwich game. this is my new lunchtime favourite! brb i’m off to make some more confit tomatoes in my last post, i asked what i should confit next and well, tomatoes was what i landed on! these are so delicious and rich in flavour. almost more so than the slow roasted ones i did a few weeks back! i tried a different method with my confit this time too, slowly cooking the tomatoes in oil in the oven at a low temp for around an hour and a half as opposed to on the hob. the result?! sweet, rich tomatoes that really level up your sandwich game. this is my new lunchtime favourite! brb i’m off to make some more i’m beyond excited today! after months of eyeing this eyeshadow palette, i finally ordered and got the @kathleenlights x @colourpopcosmetics so jaded! kathleen is my most favorite beauty guru of all times, i absolutely love her sense of humor and her honesty and she’s also one of the most stunning human beings i’ve ever seen. and this palette is equally beautiful, with the vibrant colors and different formulas and the shade names... i can’t wait to create my first look with this gem! featuring: @colourpopcosmetics so jaded palette @fourthraybeauty you’re super fresh kit avocado superfood face mask, avocado and aloe double shot serum and avocado face milk @fourthraybeauty rose lip mask @avonczsk kohl eye liners in ocean blue and deep violet everyone’s topic of conversation is obviously the announcement last night. i personally can’t wait for cinemas and soft plays etc to reopen for the kids, holidays, eating out and a wonder around @homesenseuk call it what you want soms heb je van die dagen dat je der even helemaal doorheen zit but hi, your not the only one staypositive still pretending it’s summer even though it’s rained the entire day use code “ellss20” for 20 off my phone case and everything else @coconutlaneuk still pretending it’s summer even though it’s rained the entire day use code “ellss20” for 20 off my phone case and everything else @coconutlaneuk sold first custom jumper up for grabs, £38 size xl swipe for close ups receive a free tattoo print with each order! to purchase drop me a dm, payments via paypal. only a few more days until our st. patty’s day ‘danas are in your paws! which one is your favorite? www.zoeysdesignco.com you ever get a referral and your brain is just like well that is exactly what i was like when i received a referral recently for a patient with ‘carnitine palmitoyltransferase ii deficiency’ cpt2 neither myself or my colleagues had ever heard of this. so i left myself extra time to research as well as lease with dietitians outside the trust that were known to the patient absolute godsends for those who were interested in learning more from my recent stories.. here’s what i learned: this is a rare condition that affects fat metabolism in the body. it can affect either one of two enzymes. cpt 1 enzyme: helps get fatty acids inside cells cpt 2 enzyme: helps make the body can use fatty acids once inside cells there are 3 mains types: 1. lethal neonatal form 2. severe infantile hepatocardiomuscular form 3. myopathic form the first two associated with severe multi system diseases, characterised by liver failure with hypoketotic hypoglycaemia, cardiomyopathy, seizures and early death. the 3rd form is associated with exercise induced muscle pain and weakness as well as occasional myoglobinuria. with this particular patient they have cpt2 which prevents the body from using certain fats for energy, particularly during periods without food fasting it’s very important that those with this condition eat frequently. the reason for this is to prevent low blood glucose levels as well as preventing the body from using fats as an energy source. see slides for possible complications of the condition. another that may arise is called rhabomyolysis. this is a breakdown of damaged skeletal muscle. muscle breakdown cause a release of myoglobin into the bloodstream. a protein that stores oxygen in muscles. if you have too much, it can cause kidney damage. it can be treated with iv fluids, some require dialysis or haemofiltration. medications such as bicarbonate and certain kinds of diuretics can help keep the kidneys functioning. depending on availability; patient tolerance compliance and oral intake may impact the type of supplement that is chosen. these supplements typically are made up up 200mls with water also squash, fj and certain foods you ever get a referral and your brain is just like well that is exactly what i was like when i received a referral recently for a patient with ‘carnitine palmitoyltransferase ii deficiency’ cpt2 neither myself or my colleagues had ever heard of this. so i left myself extra time to research as well as lease with dietitians outside the trust that were known to the patient absolute godsends for those who were interested in learning more from my recent stories.. here’s what i learned: this is a rare condition that affects fat metabolism in the body. it can affect either one of two enzymes. cpt 1 enzyme: helps get fatty acids inside cells cpt 2 enzyme: helps make the body can use fatty acids once inside cells there are 3 mains types: 1. lethal neonatal form 2. severe infantile hepatocardiomuscular form 3. myopathic form the first two associated with severe multi system diseases, characterised by liver failure with hypoketotic hypoglycaemia, cardiomyopathy, seizures and early death. the 3rd form is associated with exercise induced muscle pain and weakness as well as occasional myoglobinuria. with this particular patient they have cpt2 which prevents the body from using certain fats for energy, particularly during periods without food fasting it’s very important that those with this condition eat frequently. the reason for this is to prevent low blood glucose levels as well as preventing the body from using fats as an energy source. see slides for possible complications of the condition. another that may arise is called rhabomyolysis. this is a breakdown of damaged skeletal muscle. muscle breakdown cause a release of myoglobin into the bloodstream. a protein that stores oxygen in muscles. if you have too much, it can cause kidney damage. it can be treated with iv fluids, some require dialysis or haemofiltration. medications such as bicarbonate and certain kinds of diuretics can help keep the kidneys functioning. depending on availability; patient tolerance compliance and oral intake may impact the type of supplement that is chosen. these supplements typically are made up up 200mls with water also squash, fj and certain foods i’m way to excited about the weather right now can’t wait to be walking around in skirts and dresses again without 2 layers of pantyhose woke up and decided to do a 60s look this morning who else gets photobombed by their baby’s messy nursery?

i am facing the same problem and trying to stay creative at home by doing more daily-life photography. here are 3 tips to stay creative at home based on my experience if you also have felt demotivated to create: 1. make a bucket list of activitiesimages you would like to capture. it is important to remember that our goal is to elevate what could otherwise be a snapshot, into something artistic. 2. try not to remain static and stay in one position when taking pictures. play with props and angles can help you create more dynamic and interesting images. 3. make sure that you have some extra light sources besides the ceiling lights. i am using a ring light and considering purchasing a light box soon. nothing beats the love between a girl and her first pony swipe to see the un edited version thanks for the photo bomb daddy super thankful i followed my heart and took the risk to continue the journey with my online business so i could spend everyday with you shoes from @converse jeans from @dv8fashion shirt from @rebelliousfashion top from @prettylittlething coat from @dv8fashion sunglasses from @rayban did you have the opportunity to enjoy this beautiful day?

this weekend i decided it was finally time to bring back the flatlays and have a little photoshoot! it's been months since i've created anything like that for instagram. i've just been working my way through all the london content. i ended up scrolling through my page for a little while...bloody hell there's been an evolution and a half! i think i'm just feeling a bit nostalgic, the blog is quickly approaching it's 1st anniversary and so much has changed during that time. i never intended for this to be coping mechanism through covid, i don't think covd had even reached the uk when i started this.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ well after boris’ address last night, hopefully the end is in sight and we will soon be able to resume our lives in the ways we want to for now, here’s a bit of the bag of dreams! manifesting the life of my dreams, so expect a lot of content coming your way. take your dreams seriously i really do believe that good things will happen this year! do you manifest? if yes, what are you manifesting right now? 𝒯𝒽𝑒 𝒟𝑒𝒹𝒾𝒸𝒶𝓉𝒾𝑜𝓃 𝐼𝓈 𝑅𝑒𝒶𝓁 did i literally just put one press on nail so that it would look like my nails were done for this video? yes, yes i did did i use lash glue for the nail instead of nail glue because i couldn’t find any? yes, yes i did also, could i have not told you this and just let you think that i have cute nails…probably but hey where’s the fun in that? happy today’s caption is going to be short and sweet because your girl has an exam in literally 2.5 hours and i need to prepare my self to fail just kidding i actually studied well for this one so hopefully i ace it now time for the review this @renskincare global protection day cream is honestly confusing so, it’s meant to be a face cream however i don’t like the smell. it’s too sweet. like is that even possible? it smells like really sweet candy and tbh it’s way too strong for something that is supposed to go on my face. the smell lingers too and i can’t stand it. thank you, next! on a better note it’s really good as a hand cream i didn’t want to waste the product so i’ve been using it on my hands instead. the smell is still there but because it’s not on my face, it’s more bearable. the cream itself is very moisturizing and doesn’t leave your hands feeling greasy. let’s chat are you a procrastinator like me? what do you do to help you stay focused with either school, work or even just in general? the copyright to all visual andor written content of this post belong to @adashofsimplicity any use of this content without the explicit written permission of and license from the copyright owner is an infringement of copyright laws and violates instagrams terms of use and community guidelines. working from home as a mom with a toddler who is also home seems sooooo impossible.⁣ i still cannot believe that it has been literally almost a year of this.⁣ depending on the day, my office is this whole house- huddie’s room, bed, kitchen and even the car. on top of blogging, creating content, making lunch and being the it department when fixing kindle issues- i rarely get to sit down because i'm constantly doing 100 things at once.⁣ is it hard? yes!

everyone needs this in your life. it repairs the skin barrier, which is vital when using high strength acids! intense hydration, smooth skin. what more could you ask for. the inkey list hyualaronic acid serum so far so good, it sinks into the skin almost as soon as you out it on. no sticky residue. very happy. the ordinary niacinamide 10 zinc 1 i included this product for an extra boost in niacinamide. i have read so many great reviews about this and so far it has shown incredible results for my skin. @squeakybeanveg kick of tikka is my newest addiction. i've had it in sandwiches, on its on, in fajitas on pizza and honestly i'm still in love with it summer is not cancelled the gyms are opening in april and we’ll hopefully be having a summer what more could you want?!

what better way to celebrate your one year surgery anniversary then with a photoshoot?!?! it seems so surreal that it’s already been a year since i had it truly has changed my life in so many ways. obviously the most noticeable is the almost 100lbs i have lost but not as noticeable is how much happier i am. happier with my new found love of working out, happier with the relationship i have with food, the energy i have and with the love i have for myself. this photoshoot was more then just capturing content photos for me, this shoot was capturing the new found love i have for myself. these photos captured all the hard work i have put in this past year mind, body and soul!!! it may seem cheesy but this tool has given me so much more then my health!! i am forever grateful that i had the opportunity to change the course of my life. now let’s be real, it’s not without work but it was worth all the sweat tears along the way!!! i can’t wait to show you guys the photos from this photoshoot!! the fact that my smile shows true happiness and not a front for covering up all the sadness i felt about myself in the before photo. yes i loved sharing this magically experience with my niece but that smile hid so much sadness about how i felt about myself. i don’t generally post photos from before my surgery because i just feel such sadness for that version of myself. i know part of this journey is loving that version of myself because my worth is more than a number on a scale!!! that version of me deserved everything that this version of myself feels. i will always remember and love on the person i was before this journey because i will always carry a piece of her with me milky bar cheesecake protein chocolate energy balls you can never have too much chocolate mix together: 1 cup oat flour⁣⁣ 12 cup chocolate protein powder⁣⁣ 14 cup cacao powder 14 cup syrup i used a mixture of agave and maple 12 cup nut butter i used almond⁣⁣ teeny bit of plant based milk don’t want the mixture to be too thick⁣⁣ optional: maca powder and flax also drizzled mine with @sweetfreedomuk chocolate sauce protein chocolate energy balls you can never have too much chocolate mix together: 1 cup oat flour⁣⁣ 12 cup chocolate protein powder⁣⁣ 14 cup cacao powder 14 cup syrup i used a mixture of agave and maple 12 cup nut butter i used almond⁣⁣ teeny bit of plant based milk don’t want the mixture to be too thick⁣⁣ optional: maca powder and flax also drizzled mine with @sweetfreedomuk chocolate sauce our heart-shaped ring is a dream launching in 5 days!!

if i can do this anyone can!! i wanna get to where these women are and i’m not going to stop until i do!! here’s a quick guide on saves shares, and what to do with this information! it’s known that ig is prioritizing content that has strong share and save numbers. this can be confusing as likes and comments are much more prominent. it’s important to not forget about these 2 metrics and here we provide some information on how to make the most of them! it can be hard at times to see growth in an account, and one way to measure that is to see if over time more people are sharing and saving your content. if that is happening, you know you are on a path to content-market-fit. we just made up this term but “product market fit” is commonly used in startups as a way to indicate, in the simplest terms, that a company has found its groove and that they are offering the right product to the right people. in the same way, an uptick in saves and shares means you are doing something right. it means you are giving your audience exactly what they want to see, and that is the true magic we are all striving for. don’t ignore these indicators, and when you start to see that shift, it means it’s now more than ever to double down on the type of content you see strongly resonating. let us know, do you use past save and share metrics to plan future content? girl put ur records on what are you listening to lately? i need recommendations. look at what women are earning!

i’m really trying to focus on my body and mind this year as i want to be generally the healthiest me i can be happy that i’ll be walking away from lockdown with that kind of motivation whyyy is it so windy today!? i get excited yesterday because there was a tiny bit of sunshine and now this is what i’m wearing out the house. i want spring weather please lazy day outfit for a post office run coat @debenhams hoodie @ebayuk leggings @primark caution: dangerous curves ahead @acdc your life is as good as your mindset d e n i a l i’ve never been to egypt before but i sure as hell have been in denial the nile please just laugh at my jokes, there’s a pandemic out there and i’m driving myself insane. how are you coping? soooo denial, it’s a lovely place to be, every cloud has a silver lining, nothing that you do has ramifications life is just peachy if you stay there for too long you go past the point of no return. i was in denial for so so long it did me no good whatsoever. denial about my financial state, denial about how i could live my life, denial about my bank balance. for so long i was in financial denial i have so many regrets, i could have nipped this in the bud way before i got to £23k debt but i didn’t. i’ll be honest i don’t check my bank account every day, i still hope that someone somewhere is scamming my bank account @firstdirect will call me up with all this money that i’ve ‘lost’ over the years. i do check my bank a lot more than i used to, it used to get checked from the 25th to the end of the month then i would wing it again until the 25th. if you are full of those anxious thoughts or you are thinking it will all work out by itself this is your message to say it’s up to you babe. get to know your finances, it’s uncomfortable and scary but now is the time to say no more. nip it in the bud. you’ve got this. my inbox is always open chores done! i was always hesitant to start olaplex because of the but it’s actually so worth it. as someone who frequently dyes their hair i have naturally black hair and i am at a dirty blonde now, this is exactly what i needed to keep my hair in shape and do some damage repair. my hair finally has frizz control and it just doesn’t look so shocked anymore. can’t wait to see how much better it’s going to get after more consistent use! today we hear from katya, founder of @lukewarmsentiments. hi! i'm katya and i founded @lukewarmsentiments in 2018 with my great pal rojin. we wanted to design honest, silly, and surreal cards that mirrored how we really speak to our friends and family. they’re inspired by all of our awkward sometimes hilarious interactions. after putting the company on hold for a while, we decided to pick things back up during the first lockdown and re-launched our website last july. this year we're hoping to go to our first trade show and double our range of cards. we're also going to add umbrellas and socks to our gift collection it’s definitely a challenge trying to start a business like this, margins are low and i’ve been balancing it with my day job, but it’s absolutely worth the effort. i’ve also really loved finding a community of supportive, talented creators here, it's so inspiring! my main advice would be, don’t forget to look after your mental health and your back! and don’t worry too much about what people think of your idea, feedback is important but you’ll know what’s working and what isn’t as you progress. thanks for reading! another favorite cardigan it’s so comfortable and has pockets!! from @targetactually also love this new disney princess graphic tee from them as well! this week’s already off to a busy start but i hope it’s a great week outfit linked in my ltk in my bio p.s. yes i realize it looks like i’m missing an arm which of my scarf outfits do you prefer. i know my fave adpr dr. organic calendula skin moisturiser the calendula range from dr. organic is especially designed for sensitive skin and is fragrance free. so even if you have sensitive skin you can with dr. organic! as well as calendula the moisturiser also has echinacea extract and aloe vera that's are also soothing and gentle on sensitive skin. with ginger extract that has calming properties. i have really liked using this moisturiser! i have found it really moisturising without making any greasy areas of my face worse. the moisturiser feels really smooth to apply and sinks into my skin fast. this moisturiser does not leave my skin looking shiny at all and creates the perfect base for my makeup. i don't change my moisturiser that often but have liked using it so much, with it feeling light on my skin and adding just the right amount of hydration, i definitely want to keep it in my skincare routine. i also love the packaging of this little pot of moisturiser and think it's so much easier to get just the amount you need from a pot than if it was in a tube. @drorganic busy minding my own business dnt txt jk i’m just trying to release stress and worry all while getting my sht done. college is truly a beast objects in mirror are closer than the appear... x: @logaanpaigee puffy sleeves? entirely leopard print? oversized? think i’ve died and gone to dress heaven. t u e s d a y i really need to find a mirror for in here. i took it down months ago as it started to rust with the intention of replacing straight away. the reality is the tiny mirror shown here is what i do my make up with every day, i really need to find one, have a massive empty wall that i never show and honestly i can barely see at 5am without glasses as it is anyone else have a purchase they are really putting off because haven’t found something they love or will work in the space? hope you have all had a lovely day. don’t be shy add some more scrunchies!

don’t get me wrong, lockdown has been stressful, this one has been the hardest of them all and with mr k at work everyday there’s been days the kids have driven me batshit crazy! but i’ve also loved having them with me every day, i’ve got used to them being here, i’ve got used to living in a little bubble and i’ve loved all the extra time we’ve been given with our kids! my point is don’t let social media, or anyone, tell you how you should be feeling. it’s ok to feel happy to get some freedom from your kids, but it’s also ok to feel anxious about it. it’s ok to be so excited at the prospect of a big celebration on 21st june, but it’s also ok to stay home that day. it’s ok to feel optimistic at the timeline that we’ve been given, but it’s also ok to have your doubts and not want to celebrate too soon. and it’s also ok if you still want to be cautious in socialising. don’t feel any pressure to do anything any sooner than you feel comfortable with. on the whole i’m enjoying the positivity that yesterday bought. i’m so excited at the prospect of reuniting with everyone i’ve missed so badly! things seem a little lighter, a little brighter and a little more hopeful, and i think we all needed that. but i just wanted you to know that you can feel whatever way you want about it, don’t let anyone tell you any different. summer on the brain! can’t wait for the lake to thaw out so we can make more memories fishing, boozing, and laughing! ya know same, but just a tad warmer! summer on the brain! can’t wait for the lake to thaw out so we can make more memories fishing, boozing, and laughing!

but what makes this news even better? the fact that there are some seriously hot debut albums lined up for release in the next couple of weeks. take a look at some of our picks by swiping across now @doddleoddle @sglewis @thesnuts surrounded by lv e s t h e t i c s the god that not only sends us but backs us up. this blows my mind and equally fills me with confidence especially on days i feel discouraged. new video out now “the lamps are different, but the light is the same.” save this for inspo at your next nail appointment whilst it’s not the news we’ve all been hoping for, it’s still a step forward and the end of lockdown in sight. i know for a fact, when these two have their weddings, it’s going to be huge celebration @mollyhamblin @joecogg life is all about balance swipe to see me enjoying my birthday drink if you think about it, a lot of things in life need a healthy balance! work life diet workouts and exercise with all of these, it’s so important to find the balance that works for you. everyone is different which means you shouldn’t be trying to do or follow what someone else is doing! for example, today my dad and i went out for lunch all covid safe and we had a lovely time and i didn’t worry about what i was eating or drinking, i just enjoyed myself because it’s not everyday you turn 21 i needed to relax and just enjoy myself you can be working your butt off for a goal, and it’s good to do so, but also know when you need a little break to recharge listen to what works for, that’s all that matters!

thank yku @camriabeauty for this silky, gentle and delicious lip scrub so, how are we feeling after yesterday? my screen has been filled with excitable captions and memes of returning to clubs and pubs- overflowing bubbles of optimism bursting from a 6 inch rectangle. from my own perspective- i’ve always loved being at home. i love having the comfort of a well slept in bed, warm lamps switched on as darkness drapes over the bedroom, all of my collectibles and trinkets dotted around me. but through this third lockdown, it’s all started to become a bit much. i had agoraphobia for awhile and still suffer the hangover of it’s debilitating thoughts to this day. for a time it was almost impossible to leave my house- it was a prison but it was my comfort blanket, suffocating me whilst i willingly continued to wrap myself within it. that unwelcome feeling has started to return in the last few weeks, and i’m desperate to not slip back into it’s clutches. i want home to return to being a place of relaxation and recuperation. a place where i voluntarily go to rest and seek comfort. it’s going to take some time to readjust back into ‘normal’ society and secretly i suspect it will take a little longer than 3 months, but to have a little bit of hope is worth clinging onto for dear life. and the continuing hopefulness that humans have been able to exhibit through this time makes my heart do little flips of happiness. that and the spring sunshine greige, is it grey or beige? comment below i say greige but i love it anyway!

last week from today i remember the weather being in the low 50 degrees in carmel. i come back to a heat pool of high 70 degrees in la. i guess i can say the summer is almost here? i never planned to wear my outfit this way. i wasn’t ready for the cold weather up in carmel and felt ridiculous in the long ivory skirt with a long blazer coat; however i can say i was totally digging this outfit as it grew on me later in the day. i felt like an english madam walking down the streets of a beautiful town can’t wait to take this out on the 21st l e t t h e s u n s h i n e is it just me or spring actually incoming!? hooray!

a little qotd: what makes you the happiest nowadays? technical difficulties aside this uk lady came throughhhh! absolutely obsessed with celia's closet and you should be too. we're both banking on the fact that @parishilton and y2k is here to stay her wardrobe has every color under the and our favorite @emmabrewin hat that is addicting enough to garner happy laughs from strangers and the occassional thief on the tube yes, i say tube now special guests include: @depop she's the queen of it, a clear @burberry trench, @houseofsunny, a dream of getting off the @octaviabankslondon waitlist, and a printed @moschino when the light hits just right... juno by @sundayriley affirmation of the day: i am grateful for who i am and where i have come from. i am thankful for all of it. the highs. the lows. the blessings. the lessons. the times when st hit the fan. the times when i did not act in alignment with who i want to be. the comebacks and every little thing in between. i give myself the space and love to grow.” quote from @thewellvibe happy tuesday insta friends it's been a while since my last post. i enjoyed using the @renskincare perfect canvas clean jelly oil cleanser as am cleanser or second step in my pm routine. is very hydrating and gentle. i do not recommend it to remove makeup. as you already know, i love using vitamin c in the am, and @drunkelephant c-firma is one of my favorites. it does feel sticky immediately after applying, but it sinks in skin very fast. my skin loves it. lately, i focused on the eye area and i used the @algenist power advanced wrinkle fighter retinol serum in the pm and the @renskincare vita mineral active 7 gel eye in the am. i feel like these two are so under-rated. i saw an improvement in the appearance of fine lines and i am sure this duo is responsible for that. and the last product i want to mention is the @imfromglobal mugwort mask which is just perfect for dry skin. i adore it and i am glad i found it. i want to buy the full size when i finish this mini version. did you try any of them? o b s e s s e d @refybeauty are honestly the best eyebrows products that i have ever brought. the turn out of them is so flattering and natural. the application of these products are so easy to apply in three easy steps. 1. scuplt 2. fill in with the eyebrow pomade 3. add an few finishing touches with the eyebrow pencil. i would 100 recommended the @refybeauty products, the finished look is gorgeous x more spring weather pls let that sht go. i know, i know it’s easier said than done. but, what surely is easy, is to be stuck on a thought, thing or a person. and if you’re anything like me, this happens more often than we’d like. the biggest thing it takes away, is the present. so, i’ve been trying to make a practice out of the following key words that’ve helped me stay present. 𝐁𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐞 “saloni, we breathe every second! wth you talkin about?” as simple as it sounds, breathing is a very popular grounding technique. and having tried some of the techniques first hand, i can say it makes the biggest difference. wink wink post on mindfulness coming soon 𝐀𝐜𝐜𝐞𝐩𝐭 “but, this is not what i want how can i accept?!” sometimes, it may not be the best situation to be in but having accepted it, there’s one less thing to worry about! 𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬 who doesn’t like a dance partayy? dance it out. laugh it out. cry it out. whatever floats ya boat! 𝐅𝐨𝐫𝐠𝐢𝐯𝐞 forgive and forget. you may have heard this phrase a bajillion times before. but, did you really forgive? being the bigger person takes a lot of courage. and kudos to you, if you’ve been that person.

over the last few months i have been alternating between these three serumsoils on my face at night and it’s made such a difference, my skin is the best it’s been for a long time. the sunday riley sleeping night oil was a gift and i am now obsessed with it, best product i’ve probably ever used on my skin! it is a retinol oil which helps with wrinkles, unclogs your pores, evens your skin tone and clearsprevents breakouts. sounds like this is an ad but it’s obviously not i wish i just love it!! the clarins double serum is also amazing, caroline hirons recommended it as one of her must have products so i had to try and i love it. and the ordinary serum is really good for blemish prone skin! i’m by no means a skin care expert but just wanted to share, especially the sunday riley oil as it’s so so good i obviously use cleansers, toners and moisturisers too but didn’t want to totally bore you with all of it at!! i have braids in now but i’m missing the long hair the excitement of having to go to the bank in a different town and wearing proper clothes. obvs a photo required for this thrilling outing here's to spring and the beautiful yellow brick road map to the emerald city the pub. eta sometime around june 21st i'll drink to that. @thenorthernstylist @aprincipaloffashion click save to refer back to for inspo direct link to outfit items in bio click save to refer back to for inspo direct link to outfit items in bio would you believe me if i told you this was one of two red shirts i own?

how to choose your brands colour palette start by choosing a base colour that you like and aligns with your brand identity. you should choose around 3-5 colours that not only look good together but convey the message of your business too. it’s important to stick to a colour palette as you’re making your business instantly recognisable if you don’t have the tools and need help choosing the right colour palette that reflects your brand ethos, then drop us a message save this post for later t-24 hours to my personal new years and i’m already cutting up hello gorgeous today on @soldejaneiro triple butter hair repair treatment i got this as a freebie with my @sephora order. i was so happy they offered the trial size as a promo. i have been wanting to try this mask for a while now. this was a great opportunity. just look how cute the mini looks if you love the way the brazilian bum bum cream smells, you will love the smell of this hair mask it smells identical to the cream, which i absolutely love. i tried it for the first time the other night. the texture is thicker but also very lightweight at the same time. i ended up leaving it in my hair for 30 minutes and after rinsing it off, it left my hair feeling very smooth and soft. if you suffer from drydamaged hair, i recommend you try this!! you will also love the smell have you tried this yet?

having your website link in your bio means quick access, with the majority of your audience likely to browse your items! branded highlight covers: having a cohesive brand theme is so important for businesses and influencers! do you have a specific colour that you use in your logo?

if you agree, you may want to check this out. this has amino acids plant proteins that promote healthy hair. it hydrates, detangles, and protects hair from damages caused by heat. i use this after taking a shower on wet hair most mornings. i love spraying and massaging it on my wet hair so combing will be easy and painless. i’ve been experimenting with flat and curling iron as well and this is a must for me. it leaves my hair smelling fresh. dry shampoo $10.99 this dry shampoo is powder and is very fine light. i feel literally nothing on my scalp when i am using this. it effectively cleans my oily scalp like i showered. in addition, it makes my hair look more voluminous like whaaaat?! it just simply does. i never had an issue with this leaving residue on my black hair. it is so easy to evenly apply. i also love love love the scent it is not overpowering. it just smells so clean. doctor zazzles made his tiktok debut this week. he’s much cooler than i am. and also very angry... custom made clothing with your logo branding. we are manufacture and supplier for all kind of menwomen clothes in top quality and supplying our product in the worldwide and we have good repute in the market, you can have your choice of colours... we can place your logo on the products.... you can have customize sizes.. shipping worldwide. dm for query happy tuesday the sun came out today and putting on this outfit got me in such a good mood, little bit premature to wear the birkenstock’s outside at the moment but i just can’t wait to wear this outfit out when i can getting my beloved hm mom jeans in this gorgeous colour was the best decision of the week! outfit breakdown jeans and shirt @hm bag @mango shoes @birkenstock pay me in pasta! evening all how lovely is this blooming since we first got her this isn't the exciting post i had hoped for tonight but we move fingers crossed for tomorrow i hope you all had the best tuesday 3 more sleeps before the weekend i started journaling again after receiving this @yoursmartplanner for my birthday i honestly find it makes me so productive! started on sunday and planned for the week ahead eye creams yay or nay? i know some say that eye creams are unnecessary, and are just moisturizers with a huge price tag. although it is a luxury to have one in a routine, i do enjoy using one for extra hydration around the eyes. they are typically formulated to be used on the delicate skin around the eye area, where facial moisturizers may be too strong or heavy for. @kylieskin eye cream this eye cream is formulated with blend of caffeine, green tea, vitamin e and pomegranate extracts. it does a good job hydrating and depuffing. i recommend it to those who are new to eye creams and want a simple, no-fuss kinda product. @youthtothepeople dream eye cream an awesome pick for the winter months when your skin is feeling super dry and tight. it is a very rich eye cream almost like eye butter that leaves the skin plump without causing milia. @farmacybeauty cheer up i just started testing this out recently and really love the gel to cream texture. it feels cooling on the skin and instantly brightens tired eyes. my dark circles are still there that’s not something that can be changed, but this does wake them up. do you use eye creams? lemme know your favourite one down below! gucci shelly line mini hand tote bag in classic beige gg canvas circa 1980s. slouchy style, trapeze shape with sylvie web stripe handles. front leather patch logo, interior zip pocket and phone pocket, top zip closure and leather bottom. condition report: corners are worn, canvas looks good otherwise. leather parts are worn but still in-tact. interior is clean and in really good condition. £195 a trainer love affair @veja linked on my @liketoknow.it account a trainer love affair @veja linked on my @liketoknow.it account product review swipe for application demo on my face at 7.30am this morning and a cute voiceover product: @bondisands spf 50 face sunscreen lotion, 75ml. price: £6.99 £7.99 available from @feelunique @bootsuk @superdrug about: ‘providing uva uvb protection, our fragrance-free formula is fast absorbing and gentle on the skin. developed to be water resistant for up to 4 hours so you can step in to the sun with confidence’. from bondi sands website. review: what i liked no whitecast moisturising perfect indoors and in very dry and cold weather the price ease of procurement it’s available at most retailers with quick delivery. what i didn’t like: makes face too shiny sweaty not suitable for wear in warmer temperatures stings eyes as day proceeds and makes them water. recommend?: 5050 this is a good winter spf, especially for those with dry skin like mine. it’s been slightly warmer more than 6 °c the last few days and i can’t wear this, it makes my skin dewy anyway but when my face is slightly warmer i just look sweaty. i can imagine that if you have oily skin this wouldn’t be idea at all. so this is personally a seasonal spf for me. please drop your summer spf recommendations below, gal on the search here here’s a little snippet of one of my favourite kings of leon songs: use somebody. last year, when the sun was shining, i found these garden gigs to be such a relief during the uncertain times of lockdown 1.0 do you remember those days?

always regretted not topping out this climb. must return when sandstone welcomes climbers again! quite literally counting the hours. and resisting the urge to sprint towards that finish line......not least because knowing me i’d break an ankle doing so gah, lockdowns been a tough old ride hasnt it? with the usual 'busy life' there's never too much time to really sit and think. being at home with the same people for near on 365 days, not bouncing ideas off friends, family and colleagues or having social interaction like usual has been tough. you get inside your own head a lot. i start doubting myself in situations, get bored and find problems in my usually happy life. i guess it ignites a spark of something to think about other than 'when the hell will this be over'? it's been hard for me stuart. we live together, work together, parent together and we never spend this much time together. and at times, i've really wondered if we'll even make it to see the end of this lockdown living under the same roof. because when you're locked in together, it's hard to see a way past the annoyances you feel about the other person. not even big things, just small things like stop putting your cup by the dishwasher, put it in the fucking dishwasher. don't even get me started on parenting the kids through a pandemic i am certainly no earth mother, and locking me up with them has 100 confirmed this fact. so with the assistance of gazza here, i'm going to silence my inner critic, unfuck myself and unleash my greatness and hopefully i'll be back drinking gin and fizz with my gals soon, hugging them awkwardly for all the times we've spent apart over the last year stone farm no caption necessary. behind the camera i was singing incy wincy spider which always produces the goods!

today i listened to a seminar on how to “build confidence and get out of your comfort zone” and it truly made me realize how i need to push myself to be more confident in my work life. i build my confidence each day with affirmations. saying “i accomplish what i put my mind to,” “i am capable,” “i am smart enough to be here.” this can be harder as a woman. men are more likely to fake their confidence to get the result they want. let’s change that statistic!! xx, laurie chaotic where at talk about everything from rashes to lawrence cheney! evening weights session with @roarfitnessgirl catching up with mondays upper body session followed by a protein shake: 12 banana, @phdnutrition whey protein in banana flavour and semi-skimmed milk 220 calories. t-12 hours until my next workout, run three of the week! hope you all well, i can’t wait to go back to work just a picture of me and the greatest food to exist. also featuring low-tier pink doughnut that didn't make the cut this day has been a weird one for me but i'm finishing it with a doughnut in bed so i shan't complain. have a good one, folks c’mon i wanna show you my new case @kasemedesign am i doing this thing right @ellessentially?

@palmspringssocialclub happy vibes today have you tried jojoba in your skincare? if you’re unfamiliar with jojoba, it’s a plant that stores a liquid wax in its seeds. this wax has the same molecular structure as the natural wax esters in our skin, which are responsible for keeping our skin plump. jojoba also has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and are rich in vitamins. as such, jojoba has been used for centuries in skincare to soothe, heal and restore the skin. a couple months back, @thejojobaco reached out to me, and kindly sent me two of their best selling jojoba products to try out. the products from @thejojobaco are formulated with wadi-wadi jojoba, which is unique to australia, and grown in their own farm. the two products i received were the australian wadi-wadi jojoba and jojoba water toning mist. australian wadi-wadi jojoba this product contains 100 wadi-wadi jojoba oil. the oil is extra-virgin, cold pressed and filtered 14 times. the oil comes in a beautiful glass bottle with a spray dispenser. i use this as the last step in my nighttime routine. one spray provides me enough product to cover my face and neck, and i pat the oil into my skin. the oil is lightweight and does not feel heavy at all. after using this at night, i wake up in the mornings with softer, plumper skin this is definitely a must-have for the winter time, and for those with dry skin! jojoba water toning mist this mist is formulated with pure jojoba leaf extract, vitamin c rich desert lime and rose extract. it aims to hydrate and firm the skin, and reduce the size of pores. i use this in both my am and pm routine, and this provides an instant refreshing boost of hydration to my skin. the product is super gentle on the skin, so i’d say that you can use this as many times as you’d like throughout the day! i haven’t seen any effects just yet in terms of firming and reducing the size of pores, but will continue using this, and provide any updates the only thing that i think could use improvement is the spray on the bottle it’s quite small, so not a lot of product comes out at once. i need to spray this at least 6-7 times in order to get enough mist to cover my face. pr, but opinions are my own have you tried jojoba in your skincare?

we love watching you grow moosey you were born to be real, not perfect i posted some polls in my stories a couple of days ago and i got some great feedback. i was surprised by the number of people that would like to see more real life content on my feed. and honestly i love that! i love creating ideas and concepts for my photos but i would like to include more of my everyday life and experiences on my page. i’m really happy that you would all love to see that from me i want to make this space a positive one and one that inspires too. we are all far from perfect. i think it’s so important for us to be vulnerable and share our truths and experiences. someone out there is going through similar things and might feel alone and in need of encouragement. no one but you can tell your story. that is the beauty of being imperfect! we all have a unique story to tell and i can’t wait to share mine don’t worry i will still be doing makeup and all things beauty because i love it mad science by @cadillacquer in three coats. this polish has been sitting in a drawer for quite a while, so it's got a bit of ubs ugly bottle syndrome happening. the polish itself is still perfect, though. first photo taken in direct sunlight and second photo indoors with natural light. @axisyofficial artichoke intensive skinbarrier ampoule [overall opinion] here we have the last product from axis-y that i've been using for around a month. among the 3 products i've tried, this was my least favorite. it's a hydrating and soothing ampoule that contains some skin strengthening ingredients. the formulation was pretty interesting as it contains some unique extract it has a particular scent that took me a while to get used to. though,the scent doesn't linger,which is good news. this ampoule has a gel consistency. in term of skin strengthening benefits, you'll need to use it consistently to feel a difference. during my trial period,my skin was in a relatively good condition so i don't think i've noticed much in term of this precise benefits. i think it can be use during any season by all skin type because how hydrating it is while it can be suitable for all skin type, i think this might be a nice alternative for oily skin to barrier repairing products with richer-creamier formulation. i'll probably enjoy this more during the warmer season,so i'll be putting this aside for then and update my experience more details available in my blog post pr wishing i was somewhere else instead of studying jewelry is always an amazing way to enhance a simple outfit. loving my new pieces from @analuisany check out the link in my bio to save 15 off ur next ana luisa purchase!

comment down below! tonight’s routine do you spot any of your favourites? i’ve been sitting on this video because i didn’t know what to write. my mother passed away recently and i wanted to make this for her. this song is from a chinese film and i actually watched it in theatre with my mom and her so. i had two thoughts: first, “how the heck did i get dragged into this?” second, “hey this movie is actually pretty good.” it was such a bizarre moment for me because my mom and i rarely interacted let alone watch a movie together even though we rarely got to see each other, you always thought of me and bought me gifts. little did you know that i’d trade all those things just to see you again. i wanted you to be proud of me. i wanted you to tell me you loved me. most of all, i just wanted you to stay. i wish i could see you again. i love you, mom and i’m gonna miss you. documenting the rare occasion of wearing white jeans happy wednesday walk with me though life.. and i'll have everything i need for the journey spent all of last night looking at holidays next year is going to be crazy if we are able to travel coat: @newlook tshirt: @urbanoutfitters trousers: @primark boots: @asos hello mickey @llemerci @pistache.blog @lesuucre @theparisiannoire @thenoisetier @andsave @comely.way @velvetdynasty @muse.unknown @eatmejapan @waltdisneyworld @mickeymouse @voguegram @modeblogg @esteticpart @the.memoirist g l o w g o a l s venue @wickfarmbath model @lauraels bridal wear @ellierosebridal hair @hairbybiancablue mua @meswmakeupartist lipstick @maccosmetics photography @hanadallimorephotography p a n d e m i c b a b y firstly, i think effie will hate me when i get this picture out on her 18th birthday i bought the little hat bear to do my own newborn photos with her as it wasn’t allowed to be done by a professional when she was born but the hat was way too big for her and only now fits her at 6 months! being pregnant having a baby in a pandemic has been hard. having to attend appointments, make medical decisions be in early labour alone is tough, your baby not being able to see family friends is even tougher. not having that extra support of health visitor visits, baby groups, play dates meeting up with other mums is hard and lonely. however, there are positives too. i’m so grateful to have had so much extra time as a family, jacks been around a lot more than what he would have been in usual circumstances the bond he has with effie because of this is so special. it’s nice that we’ve been able to have all of that extra family time, just the four of us. with the restrictions easing over the coming months, i can’t wait to make up for missed time and see family friends. arlo spent his birthday in lockdown last year so we will be making up for that this year too. lots of plans we had last year and this year are now in the process of being rescheduled too so thats exciting and we’ve got lots to look forward to. i can’t help feeling a little sad though too that the final date where all restrictions are meant to relax is just after i’m due back to work my maternity leave will be over. my maternity leave has pretty much been spent in lockdown it just feels a bit sad i guess?! ending on a positive, i’m so grateful that despite everything, my family have stayed healthy happy and that at the end of the day is the main thing i can’t wait for effie to be able to see our family friends so we can share our happy, content little girl who is full or character with them. first in line for cuddles is definitely auntie @meggswain though! what are you most excited for when lockdown is eased?

however small and insignificant it may seem, i said to myself that i want both my boys to get into the habit of reading every night before bed and most nights we’re successful but on a very few occasions i am unable to make this happen. instead, i opt for them mainly maleek reading to me or flickering through the pictures of a favourite book of theirs, one we’ve normally read a million times over! last night however, for the first time ever i felt ok with this because i saw that allowing maleek to take control of the story, he was able to recall what happened, telling his own narrative. he started asking questions about pictures that he had never asked before and best of all, using his imagination to explain what was happening. i realised whether i read the words to him or not, it was no big deal. he was now finding the magic that exists in books that i’ve been wanting all along mum guilt, what’s this? we’re doing the best we can and that’s all we can ask for! so before you go, what are some of the magic ways you know of that books can be used, i would love to know? ‘bleu escape’ canvas x 3 120cm x 60cm x 3 commissioned piece sold deep blues textured with ‘wetlook’ areas dm for your own custom piece outfit @zara sneakers @adidasita sunny days are coming and doesn’t it feel like spring is on it’s way?

play boost it’s no secret, i love sensory play and lately i’ve receiving a few question around why i included them in our play. so....⠀ adding a play medium to toys sand,beans,rice,jelly, whatever provides a opportunity for toys to be played with in a different way.⠀ sensory play engages more than one sense touch,taste,smell,sound,sight which provides a better foundation for retaining learnt skills⠀ encourages different skill development fine motor, hand eye coordination⠀ encourages imaginative play⠀ but honesty, the reason why i love sensory play so much is it provides us with an opportunity to get more play out of our toys, i can chuck a babies puzzle way to simple for orson into a tray with play dough and ors will sit there and use that puzzle to stamp, scoop and play with a toy that normally he wouldn’t touch, which i think is pretty cool! this dress was made for romantic walks on the beach morning everyone, so we’ve moved the bedroom around in the last couple of days, we’ve managed to create a bit more space and give it a bit more of a cosy look so i’m looking forward to sharing some more photos with you but for now i’m loving the textures of the bedding set over the rug... what do you think? would you go for plain bedding or patterned bedding?? easter table last year’s easter table was very simple. i tried the bunny ear napkin fold and drew a bunny face on a wooden egg. i fancy more colour this year. what’s your usual easter table style?

the first three are from the pages of gyms and studios. the next is from a pt who i have a few mutuals with, the next three are from the pages of personal trainers qualifications not verified all female which somehow makes me even more disappointed, i expect more from you to summarise in case you don't see the problem: i'm already making myself cry over the fact my clothes don't fit...i don't need you to normalise and recommend rapid weight loss when i'm feeling vulnerable and anxious. i was inspired to post this open letter by some wonderful people on here who are fighting the good fight against the diet culture denizens: they are tagged below! @isarobinsonnutrition @elsfoodnfit @franeatsanddrinks @livlivinlife @liamoves @jemimabeann @finding.ro @millygfit @emilysworld @abseatsss @recoveryconnor @shivfitnfood @amiieats who i only just found on insta followed on tiktok: the ed hub of the world @fionasimpson also, i know this whole scrolly thing is being overplayed but honestly there is something so satisfying about it all lining up, especially as the original post gets longer. i have a 247 bedhead look but i work it today i'm joining in with @thetailsofthor thanks for inspiring me too @walterthecockerspaniel my quote of the day is 'always remember to fall asleep with a dream and wake up with a purpose' i'm a sucker for a good inspirational quote! if you've got any faves let me know and join in with pawsitive wednesday {ootd} but not. can’t wait for the day where we can wake up and this will be the outfits she can choose again, sunshine is definitely good for the soul and summer clothing is just so much happier than autumnwinter clothing. hurry up spring good morning how are we all today?

let me know your faves in the comments part 3 in growing t cells! here i finally conclude the most important experiment i do in the lab. i will go into further details in future posts, but this is a little overview of the experimental concept! find out how i stain my proteins! i used this method throughout my phd. i hope its interesting, again reach out if its hard to understand. its always good to improve my explaining and communication to help others! ps: diagrams created in biorender.com go check it! hunting mode: activated. new blog post finally i give you a new blog post and an update on my thoughts on the cbd life and it’s benefits, ft @thetoniccbd @westlabsalts and jacob hooey products. read to find out what benefits i’ve found, something strange i’ve noticed, and what i want to try next. link in bio let me know in the comments what you’ve tried or would like to try, and if you have or do use cbd products how they help you! ft. @cetaphilindia if you have dry skin or sensitive skin, then this product is totally a boon for you. i have a combination skin type, with an oily t zone and the rest of my face is quite dry. in this dry season, my face tends to get quite dry and flaky, which is not at all cute. so, whenever i try this face cleanser, it thus not make my face dry at all. since it contains propylene glycol, it leaves your skin well moisturized without making it oily. this cleanser removes the dirt and grime from your face but will not remove your makeup totally if you are wearing any pros: very gentle on the skin soothes the skin and moisturizes as well. does not clog your pores removes dirt and grime from the face leaves your face soft reduces the size of acne and redness. it has a non-irritating and fragrance-free formula. maintains the ph cons: do not eliminate acne from the face does not remove makeup if you are wearing any it cannot be used to deep cleanse your face. contains sls and parabens 𝘒𝘪𝘯𝘥𝘭𝘺 𝘯𝘰𝘵𝘦: skin care is personal and individual. what works for me may or may not work for you. listen to your skin and use products according to its needs. always perform a patch test before trying out new products. ⁣⁣until then, stay tuned keep blooming i must of done something right to deserve you in my life. mama loves you it’s official, sping is here are you trying to start waking up earlier? don’t make these 3 mistakes have you ever found yourself trying to get up earlier to work on things you don’t have the time for? or you want to start implementing a morning routine but when it comes to getting out of bed in the morning, you’re just too tired? there are a few things you should know when you’re trying to get up earlier. but first, let me give you a few reasons why you should wake up earlier even if you hate it optimised cognition boosts confidence happiness helps manage stress enhances productivity so much more so without further ado, here are 3 things you don’t want to do if you want to get up earlier: 01. forget that your morning starts the night before don’t expect to get up early after trying to brave 5 hours of sleep. this almost never works, and when it does, it makes waking up earlier unsustainable in the long term. make sure you’re getting 7 to 8 hours of sleep every night⁣⁣⁣ 02. let the voices in your head take over some thoughts that might sound familiar after your alarm goes off in the morning: ‘you can just wake up earlier tomorrow morning’ ‘you need more sleep’ ‘you’ll be tired later if you get up now’ try this the moment you feel yourself hesitate on something you should do, count 5-4-3-2-1 to activate your prefrontal cortex and interrupt the habit of overthinking, self-doubt, and fear. if you don’t move in 5 seconds, your mental habits take over and kill your instinct to change and step out of your comfort zone. as soon as 5 seconds are up, bolt out of bed before you suck yourself into all of the reasons you shouldn’t. 03. have ‘rest’ days one mistake i made when i started getting up earlier was to sleep in on sundays. it messed up the consistency of waking up early and ultimately lead to more days of sleeping in and not doing my morning routine. to make sleeping earlier and waking up earlier easier, wake up early every day of the week. not just weekdays⁣⁣⁣ don’t forget to like save if you found this helpful xx i’m wearing the joah beauty endless longwear liquid lipstick in the colors gym sesh. this lipstick it comes in 10 shades; it’s super lightweight lasts up to 16 hours! it’s cruelty free, stays vibrant all day and it’s transfer proof! that means you can wear this under your face masks. in partnership with @joahbeauty get 35 off any order. use the link in my bio for coupon code. late mornings in bed are my favourite late mornings in bed are my favourite pochette metis appreciation day! i felt like the shape of the metis would go well with a uniform-inspired outfit, so i went out of my comfort zone and actually put on a skirt for oncei have been struggling with my confidence again lately so i feel a bit uncomfortable posting pictures of myself, but i need to challenge that critical inner voice a bit. wishing everyone a wonderful wednesday! i couldn't very well not do donut stamping over a polish inspired by iced donuts, right?

i have seen some influencers and people !recommending! products, which can be a good thing! but even if the products work for them, they may not work for you! it can be a good thing to do research on it and at least knowing what your skin type is and how your skin reacts to things. not saying that everyone do it, but it's a reminder that not everything can fit your skin even if someone else thinks they work! if you have any other skin problems then you may want to check it up with a dermatologist first! there is nothing wrong with trying products if you want to! that way you quickly find out if it works for you or not! but to save the skin and save money, it can be helpful to do research first! i personally love seeing what other people use, and their opinion on the products, that way i can do more research and maybe try new products if they fit my skin! that way i know that i dont put something on my skin that my skin dosent tolerate and save money! i love when people ask me for skincare advise, and i will ofcourse help, but i also remember to bring up that i am not a dermatologist and if something works for me it may not work for you! last but not least! it is up to you to decide if you want to test products before doing research! just a friendly reminder to everyone i made some wooden happy 1st birthday bunting for my daughters birthday with a little rose gold glitter sparkle.. added a lovely touch to her lockdown celebration and i’ve popped it in her keepsake box too and it will keep forever. message me if you would like to order some bespoke bunting tones⁣ wearing @lovepanache envy in the colour chestnut tones⁣ wearing @lovepanache envy in the colour chestnut tones⁣ wearing @lovepanache envy in the colour chestnut lets talk about hyaluronic acid we made it to wednesday and looks like we’re heading out of lockdown u.k. what’s are your favourite hyaluronic acid product? do you use a separate hyaluronic acid or do you prefer to use a product with it included? i like to layer products so as long as i can layer, and with no balling. it does look like tiny little balls lol. i’m happy to use a separate product. these are my current 3 hyaluronic acid products i have in rotation. in order of preference @vichylaboratoires mineral 89 fortifying and plumping daily booster @cosrxuk hyaluronic acid hydra power essence @skinresearch.london pro hyaluronic acid facial serum lets talk about hyaluronic acid we made it to wednesday and looks like we’re heading out of lockdown u.k. what’s are your favourite hyaluronic acid product? do you use a separate hyaluronic acid or do you prefer to use a product with it included? i like to layer products so as long as i can layer, and with no balling. it does look like tiny little balls lol. i’m happy to use a separate product. these are my current 3 hyaluronic acid products i have in rotation. in order of preference @vichylaboratoires mineral 89 fortifying and plumping daily booster @cosrxuk hyaluronic acid hydra power essence @skinresearch.london pro hyaluronic acid facial serum happy wednesday oh, how i wish i was walking through here now, the beautiful old town of kos, in the beating sun looking in all the shops with @janeycenci dropping and breaking an magnet and us having to rush away a girl can dream where’s the first place you would like to go abroad after lockdown? “no winter lasts forever; no spring skips its turn”.-hal borland happy wednesday with first signs of spring weather in town. “no winter lasts forever; no spring skips its turn”.-hal borland happy wednesday with first signs of spring weather in town. happy hump day halfway through the week already!

i did also try the chocolate-covered oreos which were decadent for sure but very tasty nonetheless. a lot has changed since i visited her so there’s a lot more on offer and i think the displays are only getting better by the day! it’s wonderful to see such wonderful people and businesses thriving and striving to always improve, and @signature.strawberries is a perfect example of this keep it up! the sun is shining bright today my little darling jewellery always makes hump day better wow!

say it with your chest if you know, you know...... today, i'm giving you guys a sneak peek into my strategy process on audience profiling. all my clients go through this profiling exercise with me. it is super specific, and you might not be able to answer these questions about yourself unless you do some deep thinking. but it is needed. the more specific you get about them, the more clarity you will achieve. knowing your audience means you know exactly where to find them, how to find them and how to sell to them. nailing down this bit in your strategy is super important because it sets the foundation for your marketing actions in the future. their actions will be driven by their emotions. you won’t be able to fully know someone, but by mapping out as much information as you know about them, you would be able to predict their behavior more. what is that one thing you are struggling with when finding out who your target audience is? let me know in the comments down below! stay tuned for the next part, where we write a story on how your target audience discovers your brand. slow down often. count your blessings. be kind to your heart. believe in new beginnings. @poetryofdhiman these points may seem simple but they make such a big difference when done! sometimes all you need to do is slow down, have gratitude, practice kindness remain hopeful! if you’re seeking change, look at your current reality, look within... first. as some things are out of our control. but hold on to hope knowing that things can and will change, in gods perfect time. ekkkkk, i've got a lot in my mind it's literally giving me headaches lol i need a whole day of mind decluttering haha for real tho but anywayyyy, how's your week so far? i hope it's treating you well. if not, it's okay i bet you're not alone out there. mine, well i've been so distracted by lots of things haha. feel free to dump your location: little tokyo blok m special thanks to muthia happy wednesday, i don’t know about you but this sunshine is making me excited for spring. @lauralawton i love when i get to pot or repot plants because i love getting to touch the soil, it makes me feel connected to nature and i always feel so calm and grounded after. yesterday i potted up an ivy propagation that i’ve been rooting up in water and i called her a freaky girl bc just look at her!

[product review][updated] anessa perfect uv sunscreen skincare milk spf50 pa i’ve always loved and relied on japanese sunscreens for my spf so here’s my attempt at trying out another overly hyped one just to see if it can beat my hg from bioré. claims provides high protection from the sun and gets stronger with heat, sweat, and water. moisturizes and protects skin from dryness. contains 50 skincare ingredients. texture and scent it has a very milky, oily, and runny consistency that can easily be spread along the skin without fear of dragging. doesn’t leave a whitecast and it doesn’t pill even when reapplied. has a mild citrusy scent that reminds of orange yoghurt which doesn’t linger and not at all that bothersome. key ingredients zinc oxide, hyaluronic acid, titanium dioxide, camellia sinensis leaf water my experience this sunscreen reminds me so much of the aloe soothing sun cream from cosrx if it was more mattifying. to be honest, i kinda liked it but i don’t see myself reaching for it especially with that hefty price tag. it’s very important to shake the bottle first before applying the product to the skin. it has a metal ball inside that can help combine the mixture more efficiently. i was doing it wrong for the last couple of weeks and noted such a huge difference compared to when i just use it out of the box. if you’ve read my original review on this, you’ll know what i’m talking about. this one’s very moisturizing and it doesn’t sting and cause my eyes to tear up. i’m glad that it doesn’t leave a whitecast nor does it pill when i reapply. i prefer my sunscreens to come free of any fragrance but i didn’t mind the one on this at all. i’ve come to realize that everything expensive will have to have some fragrance somehow, lol! finally, the finish of this was quite matte and powdery on my skin and was a bit tacky to the touch. i’d recommend this for all skin types with the mattifying effect to go in favor for those who are oily skinned. srp: usd 40.00 60ml i hope you all liked this review. i still would like to try the gel version of this sunscreen to see which one will actually perform better on me. my work bestie, @laurrr.marie is celebrating her birthday today, and she did this cute wing yesterday that i decided to try and show off today's since it's also my dear friend @soupandmuffins birthday too, i did it purple, because that's the color i think of when i think of her. i used @colourpopcosmetics aura out palette, @limecrimemakeup new liquid liner in lavender, and also really loving @lanolips rose gold 101 ointment for that perfect pop of natural color, that just looks like flushed skin. hehe, works for too, right? also special mention to @glossier future dew, it's been a while since i've used it and personally, i love it. when you think of certain people, do you also associate them with a color? just me? panko breadcrumbed cauliflower bombs with fountain of sweet tang sauce some of you may notice that these babies are making a reappearance on @cams.cooks and for good reason too see below where i have shared the ingredients and method so you can put this dish into action yourselves ingredients: head of cauliflower 150ml of double cream 100ml of milk 100g flour 280g of panko breadcrumbs roughly 1tsp of each but up the measurement to suit personal preference: paprika garlic granules onion granules salt and pepper cumin for the sweet tangy sauce: 100ml soy sauce 2tsp hoisin sauce 2tsp honey 1tsp brown sugar 3 cloves of garlic grated slithers of fresh ginger method: 1. grab your head and cut the cauliflower into bite size pieces once done set aside 2. place the flour and all mentioned seasonings in a bowl then add the milk plus double cream 3. mix well until you achieve a smooth like batter 4. spread your panko breadcrumbs onto a plate 5. dip your cauliflower pieces into the batter then coat them in the panko breadcrumbs, shake off the excess 6. place the cauliflower pieces on a baking tray and repeat process till all cauliflower’s are dressed in the crumbs 7. place in an over at 180c for roughly 30-45mins or until golden crisp 8. whack all your sauce ingredients into a pan and heat allowing to come to a gentle simmer- achieving a near gloss syrup consistency 9. cauliflower at the ready, drizzle the sauce over 10. enjoy!! note: i am notorious for free hand so i have estimated measurements when it comes to the seasoning, take full reigns as it really depends of preference of heat etc! if you give them a whirl let me know taking these made me realise how much i need to clean my laptop screen inspo @jesshunt2 feeling spring or summer good morning friends! questions for you: have you seen this video yet?

enjoy this gorgeous day ahead and pour in some light. how many times have you faced this? you have a hundred thoughts going on in your head, and you cannot tell the beginning or the end apart. one thought jumbles up with another, and before you know it, you have a concoction of random thoughts that lead you nowhere. thinking in our own heads can sometimes confuse us more than clarifying what we should be doing or where we are headed. having conversations with another individual who doesn't view things in the same frame of reference and doesn't live in your head can help you iron out these thoughts into clear information streams that lead to action. this individual can be a friend, family member, or a coach. however, make sure that they can offer you two non-negotiable things: 1. a space to explore your deepest thoughts and desires without judgments 2. a space to help you help yourself rather than giving advice these are intricate thoughts, close to your heart and identity, and baring them open requires courage and vulnerability from your side and confidentiality, trust, and respect from the listener. if you'd like me to work with you as your coach to detangle your thoughts, book a free 30-minute clarity call with me to get to know each other better and help you help yourself move forward. we had our first @tokyotreat box today! there is a little story about this, @mpozo8 bought for a year. as we were supposed to get married last year and been on our honeymoon this year to japan then corona happened, so this is a little thing that make us look forward to the day we can actually go to japan there will be a part two in reels tomorrow! b o o k r e v i e w the girl with the louding voice by abi daré ️️️️️5 “i want more than just a voice, i want a louding voice. i want to enter a room and people will hear me even before i open my mouth to be speaking” i truly regret not reading this story sooner. this is a book that i will recommend to everyone. we learn the heartbreaking story of adunni, who is determined to be educated and goes through the unthinkable to be a light for the women in her village. adunni may be my favorite protagonist to date. her bravery, determination, and loyalty are unmatched. this book was easy to read, once i adapted to adunni’s language. i loved the short, but dense chapters! easily a five star book. i will be thinking about this story for a long time. qotd: who is one of your favorite protagonist from your 2021 reading?

oil-based cleansers are designed to remove oil-based products such as make-ups spfs. is it really necessary? generally, no. most cleansers nowadays are formulated with enough surfactants to remove oil-based products that we put on our face. most cleansers now can remove spf and light make-up. but if i wear heavywater proof make-up, i double cleanse so i don't have to use more water-based cleanser with just a single cleanse that can potentially leave my skin too dry. i would rather use 2 gentle formulas than one strong formula bec i have sensitive skin. still up to you tho. here's a review of the cleansing oil that i've been using lately.

here is another local brand that i would love to salute @baehanna.skinlab i've been trying these 2 products from the brand, bae hanna for almost 1 month. pardon my delay for the review. my skin has been crazy thus i waited for my skin to be better before finalizing my thoughts to present a fair review. note: i received a travel size of both products, approximately for 1 month usage let's start with the cleanser. having an oily,acne prone, i'd always opt for foaming cleanser but a gel cleanser that could give the satisfying clean post wash is also my choice. skintox colloidal oatmeal pore-rifying gentle cleanser 30ml low ph: 5.5 gel type that lathers well it's gentle for both am and pm routines; i rarely put on makeup since the pandemic started, so it's great have a gentle cleanser after all the long hours of using face mask it cleanses dirts and impurities,leaving my skin clean and soft, without disrupting my skin's natural moisture. no taut sensation post rinsing i do think it helps in controlling the excessive sebum concern although airless pump is quite a good packaging,i do experience the hardness to press the pump: the gel cleanser doesn't dispense smoothly,it kind of spits out not at the targeted palm area ratings: performance 55 packaging 45 skintox oil control pore-rifying water cream 20g ph 6.2 soft water cream that gives instant cooling sensation although it's fragrance free, the natural scent is quite overwhelming for me it spreads easily taking short time to sink into the skin leaving a velvety matte finish it's lightweight,for me this is my go to am cream,as i'd opt for a light layers of products under the face mask. it doesn't feel suffocating, but still great at keeping my skin moisturized for a good few hours however, since it's light, i don't really reach out for it as my pm cream needed a more occlusive cream, layering multiple layers of this cream doesn't feel enough especially i sleep in an air-conditioned room i have the same complain about the packaging. probably because it is travel size, i hope the full size packaging has superb pump rating: 45 cont. below had so much fun on @radiofmr for thé @deliriumcity show with @olivierdesprince on monday night!!!

i’ve been using it for about 3 weeks now. the scent is very light, it’s not sticky at all. the packaging is so stunning i love it! it’s recommended to be used in the am it really does de puff your face in the morning, it’s one of my favorite steps. it leaves my skin so bright and supple. i love the ingredients in this! as for pricing it’s definitely a little up there but in my opinion serums are worth splurging for. i would definitely repurchase this. also it is gentle but if you’re new to vitamin c and would like to check this out i’d add a few drops in your moisturizer instead and gently introduce the product into your routine to avoid any irritation. this product is pr but my opinion is 100 my own. wednesday is leg day!!

ft. @farmacybeauty whipped greens foaming cleanser floating with one of its main ingredient: moringa moringa or malunggay mah-loong-guy as how we call it in the philippines is a plant that we commonly use for cooking. it’s also known for its medicinal and health benefits. i love cooking with it, and my husband loves moringa tea! found it interesting that it’s also one of the main ingredients for some of farmacy’s green products line, including the whipped greens cleanser received this as pr a few months ago. this one is more suitable for combooily skin types. if you’re on the dry skin type, you might want a more hydrating cleanser or find this to be a little stripping. i think i’ll use this more after winter. i like this as my second cleanse after the green clean cleansing balm!

if yes, what are some of your favourites out there?? coffee queeeeeen my latest go-to smoothie: add a huge handful of spinach, frozen banana 14 cup of apple juicewater mix the more apple juice, the sweeter blend i always blend the spinach first so it’s not chunky! add around 12 cup mix of raspberries, blackberries and strawberries, a drizzle of local honey and a little more water blend and you’re done! takes like 3 minutes total. i love smoothies especially when i can make them “green” and get a nice dose of iron in the morning and this one is so good. let me know if you try it don’t forget: if you want to save it for later click the bookmark button above this caption on the right! this also tells ig you really love my post! new interview alert, coming in hot! you guys, i'm beyond stoked...this weekend we'll have jon lee miller @jonleemiller and samantha tan @samanthaatan of st racing @saamanthatanracing in the @autoconduct studio with us. well, virtually anyway i could use everyone's input here...any questions or topics you want me to include?

if you guessed that this was the texture of an untouched super shock shadow then you are correct! specifically, this is the shade campfire from the rbk x colourpop collection. of the 4 super shock shadows in this collection, campfire is by far the most pigmented shade. while the rest of the shades in the collection function more like transformative eyeshadow toppers, this shade really stands on its own. for best application, use your finger and press or swipe onto the lid to add a orange-toned, wet-looking shine to the lids. i’m not sure why, but during the big beauty guru boom using fingers to apply makeup became so taboo. how do you feel about using your fingers to apply makeup?

i've shared on my stories where i post way more often if you wanna get exclusive content, that i'm focusing on my self-care. besides prioritizing sleep that email can wait til tomorrow!, i am also working on prioritizing overall tasks. i'm asking myself, this is task meaningful to me and how urgently do i need to do it over anything else? i also ask myself, is this something i can ask someone else to help me? this last question is key because people, especially women, tend not to ask for help. we don't want to be a burden. but, asking for help not only frees up time on our end and reduces stress, it also builds connection. and if you're afraid of asking your friends for help, go to professionals. there's nothing wrong with that and it doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you. we make the mistake of viewing doctors, teachers, even ceos as some sort of fancy, untouchable hierarchy. they're not, they're just people. talk to them, they're begging you to. there are also volunteer resources where you can text a number and immediately have someone to talk to. as an extrovert, this is game changing. dm me or comment below if you want to know what these numbers are for your country. i started reading a book called wisdom from a humble jellyfish: and other self-care rituals from nature. highly recommend if you want to learn about animals and other critters plus self-care strategies. it's honestly super cute and funny. once you gain stronger footing on your self-care, you'll find more energy to achieve your goals. and as the weather is slowly getting warmer or rather, warm for one day, freezing for the next three, i hope we'll have more opportunity to go outside and get more of that sunny vitamin d to help boost our mood! coming tomorrow our minimalist sculptural ceramic table vase features a circular body that inspires a textured ring of cream-colored porcelain. available to order at www.aimori.com on 22521 10am pst. in aid of boris’ announcement yesterday we’re throwing it back with some pics from when we weren’t grounded and were allowed to party side note: we’ve just released a new blog post surrounding social media! go ahead and check it out, the link is on our bio time for a change, breaking out this beauty again for this week’s the theme was the first day back in the office...now considering i have been going into work throughout the entire pandemic and i don’t work in an office, this theme was kind of irrelevant to my situation. but i tried to throw on a blazer, because what else screams office attire than a nice blazer; but in reality i just wear scrubs at work @thestylecount @sabrinacheema necklace from @m.calvin respectfully...sit the hell down, take a deep breath, and chill the f out...respectfully that’s all...carry on respectfully...sit the hell down, take a deep breath, and chill the f out...respectfully that’s all...carry on 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗱 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘄𝗲𝗲𝗸: 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗺𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗺𝗰𝗵𝗶 𝗠𝗲𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴: 𝗟𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗺𝗲𝗮𝗻𝘀 𝘀𝗽𝗼𝗼𝗻.

this is the chap lip lip butter in watermelon, and i got this in a swap i did with another panner on here. i have dry skin overall, and that also translates to my lips unfortunately, so i use lip balms pretty heavily. this is intended to be a hydrating product containing cocoa butter and coconut oil to help hydrate. these lip balms are sweetened with stevia to have a sweet flavor to them and comes with a variety of fruity flavors. that said, my primary concern is the hydration from this and unfortunately i didn't get much from this. it feels nice going on and provides immediate hydration but i find that it wears off pretty quickly so i have to keep reapplying it. for that reason this isn't my favorite i just need more from a product like this. i've got one more of these to use up, but after that i think i'm done with these. 25, would not repurchase. product cost: $0.46, yearly running total: $530.09 image id: lip balm tube sitting on an outdoor wooden table pastel waves to brighten cold months not just another brick in the wall i can’t believe zdc turns one march 1st!

today's good mood is sponsored by coffee planning out my weeks has been super helpful to keep me on track and really just focused on what goals i have and what i want to accomplish that week. this week i'm focusing on: content creation scouting locations reaching out to brands working on the blog launching soon i've mentioned before that i'm extremely organized when it comes to anything work, life, trips, etc. so daily planners, to-do lists and calendars are usually my go-to tools. how do you stay organized each week? because i like these pictures too.. lol ℂ𝕒𝕝𝕪𝕡𝕤𝕠 𝔼𝕧𝕚𝕝 𝔼𝕪𝕖 ℕ𝕖𝕔𝕜𝕝𝕒𝕔𝕖 by @moondustandmonarchs check them out for high quality and super cute jewelry discount code pinky10 @fentybeauty mattemoiselle lipstick in turks caicos @sheglamofficial lashes @tartecosmetics double take eyeliner you do not need to start panic dieting to lose weight by june 21st. read that again. i’ve never really understood the ‘get your body ready for summer’ mentality. i’m far more invested in creating a healthy lifestyle and a healthy body that will last me my lifetime. not just for summer wearing @womensbest i’m finding it so hard to calm down my mind lately my sleep has not been good at all! i find that as soon as my head hits the pillow, there are like a million thing flying around my head and i can’t just relax and sleep with quite a few things going on in my life or things i’m working towards as well as the pandemic itself, i feel like i have so many ideas and thoughts that come at the same time when i’m about to sleep! it’s quite frustrating my plan to help me get better sleep is: get off my phone and screens at least 30 minutes before i go to sleep read my book before i go to bed i’m going to get a note book and put it beside my bed so with any thoughts or ideas that come up that i want to write down, i don’t have to get out of bed has anyone else felt the same? you feel like there’s a lot going on and your mind just never rests?? happy wednesday! how are you guys doing? i hope your week is going well so far if you guys ever need anything, you can always dm me. i’m happy to talk or answer any questions: prgifted: in my package from @instanaturalbeauty, i also received their niacinamide serum! this serum promises to soothe the look of dryness, irritation and redness. it is said to help reduce blemishes and promote clear skin, which is a huge concern of mine. their niacinamide serum has soothing ingredients like hyaluronic acid, vitamin e, avocado oil and rosemary extract. as with all of their products, their ingredients are all natural and cruelty free! i have not tried this serum yet. i am trying to finish up my current one before i open this one. however, i am super excited to try it! i’ve heard some really good reviews on it. i’m stoked to see how it helps with blemishes what is your favorite skincare ingredient? happy hump day!

www.handmadebycatuk.etsy.com lockdown fatigue is anyone else feeling like they have nothing to share on insta nowadays? it's not quite warm enough for spring content and i'm sure you don't want to see me study all day once we are out of lockdown, i know we will all be making so many memories and i will definitely be ready to capture them all until then, we are throwing it back to autumn and lovely walks through the crunchy leaves sending love to pre-loved. keeping it short and sweet today, haven’t had a product shot in a while because i’ve just been so busy with work. but, my sister recently did a declutter so i picked up a few things from her pile, which i’m really pleased with. swipe for swatches! the @doseofcolors desi x katy lipgloss in the most is really lightweight and has a shimmery pink sparkle finish. this is, unfortunately, limited edition but have no fear, i have dupes for you. this reminds me of the pat mcgrath gloss in pale fire nectar, though there’s a pinker base color in that, and also the diamond milk fenty gloss, though it’s less shimmery and has no pink sparkles. the ashton liquid lipstick from @anastasiabeverlyhills claims to be long-lasting, full-pigment and matte. and i swear to you they are all accurate. the swatch itself took a hot minute to wash off took 2 soap washes, 1 oil cleanse and i’m sure you can see for yourself how deep and rich the color was. i definitely don’t have a lippie that’s this color, so i’m so happy to finally have one! last but not least, the @tomfordbeauty lips boys lip color in river is my newest addition to my lips boys collection yeah my collection of 2 lol. i’m not a fan of the shimmery, semi-opaque ones but river is on the more pigmented side, which i really like. just like the other 2 i have, it’s super creamy and isn’t drying at all! wellness wednesdaymindfulness is defined as, “a mental state achieved by focusing one's awareness on the present moment, while calmly acknowledging and accepting one's feelings, thoughts, and bodily sensations”. i spend most of my life on auto pilot. going through the motions, not aware of what i’m truly experiencing. i think many of us do this. practicing mindfulness allows us to be present in the moment, but it can be hard to do. as someone who has anxiety and add, i especially struggle with this. here are 3 things i do to practice mindfulness. 1. when i wake up, i don’t allow myself to go on social media or respond to any messages for at least 30 minutes. i spend that time asking myself what my intentions are for the day. 2. i practice grounding techniques throughout the day. 3. practice gratitude. focus on the positive as difficult as it may be. remember that it’s not only important to take care of yourself physically but also mentally and emotionally http:liketk.it394gy how i feel about it being 68 degrees and sunny!

our oil cleanser is the perfect start to cleansing the faceskincare routine. it works on dissolving built-up oils in the skin and also removes makeup. don't get it twisted, but you can now shop our gold twist ring at havnijewelry.com it just is and will always be @sucrecouture, for me. this valentine’s day marked 10 years since the stunning @whereskimmie launched her jewelry brand, sucré couture. the vision, the aesthetic, the art just speaks to my soul. i was sent a little black box of goodies featuring the after midnight hoops, the baguette ring, and the ruth ring. these are part of the 10 year red light special that’s live now. breathtaking. the quality of these is just out of this world. i’ve shared a couple pieces from them in the past, and they’re still going so strong. can’t wait to keep sharing these with you all, and i can’t wait for many more decades of sucré drip. would you add a necklace or earrings? ok so this is the part where i introduce myself i’m kinda nervous to say hello to y’all. can you tell i lean on the introvert scale lol? hi my name is dayana grey and i currently live with the weirdest man i know my husband and we’d like to add a brown dog to the mix soon. 2. my mom is my biggest flex. seriously i learned biblical faith, grace deep thinking through her and i’m incredibly thankful to be her daughter. 3. i asked some of my friends to describe me in one word and this is what i got: sagaciouschile, google it authenticit’s a battle resilient it’s the trauma, passionate i feel seen and one of my friendsmentor quoted meg the stallion- savage lyrics and i’m still processing that one 4. i love to study people and scripture. my goal isn’t to only be a christ follower but to have deep kingdom grace intention for the people who are currently trying to figure out what that even means create a healthy space for the “others”. sitting in rooms for a large scope of my life, with leading women and men who were blinded by the damage they were doing urged me to study out human behavior and the characteristics of what jesus and john the baptist hated so much- where does your obedience resign? in the law of church culture or in scripture analysis? has your clique become so saturated with the “good christians” that you forgot how much of a mess you were or are how’s your language and heart posture? anyway if you ever see me dip french fries in ice cream- mind your business unless you’re about to dip it with me thanks for reading idk abt you but all i’m excited for is this dress being my fit for june 21st <3 idk abt you but all i’m excited for is this dress being my fit for june 21st <3 idk abt you but all i’m excited for is this dress being my fit for june 21st <3 did this month fly by or is it just me?

did this month fly by or is it just me? i feel like i haven't had much time for anything, especially recreational reading i've had reviews to write back-to-back so a lot of work reading has been done, though it's never quite as fun. but i'm looking forward to picking this one up soon! are you reading anything good right now? all white fits hit differently all white fits hit differently all white fits hit differently these 3 shades make up the perfect set what do you use to relieve period cramps? i've been trying out this cloud 9 rollerball from @blume and have really been liking it so far. the blend of sage, geranium and peppermint is really soothing and since i'm not wearing perfume as much these days this essential oils rollerball has become my go to! the book of my dreams wasn’t feeling my face so sunglasses it is x relieved to hear monday’s announcement which has given us some hope that there is light at the end of the covid tunnel.. moving on.. let’s talk about clothes.. and what i am wearing! clothes reflect who you are, how you feel at this moment and sometimes even what you want to achieve in life? always remember whatever you wear, it should reflect the real you. your dress sense reflects your personality, character, mood, style and what actually you are as an individual. this was last week when i experimented with colours although i wouldn’t want to dress like this i think the outfit didn’t resonate with me as i prefer to wear one bright colour whether it’s a top or jacket as that’s my style preference but it did lift and brighten my mood that day for trying this look! if you want to know more about colour i am reading the little book of colour by karen haller this book is about how to use the psychology of colour to transform your life.. so if you own a bright coloured jacket or trousers or top or even a handbag why not show them off as there is no right or wrong on how you dress and no one will judge you for being fashionable.. swipe to see some colourful outfits and the book i am reading.. happy hump day! outfit details: some from my wardrobe and my daughters wardrobe including accessories @inthelifeofmarley would you be able to guess from these pictures that texas was covered in snow and below zero just a few days ago? tw ️seen a lot of posts about losing weight dieting for 21st of june boris’s dates to reopen stuff i just want to say that you do not need to lose weight by the 21st of june!! it’s pretty overwhelming to see these kinds of body shaming posts, for someone who battles with body image it hard not to feel a strange pressure to lose weight from this ‘hot girl summer’ trend flying around. we have been in and out of lockdown for a while now and its okay to have gained weight during this time. people shouldn’t promote starving yourself to achieve a skinner body... this is how to indirectly promote eating disorders and leads to a path where we create unhealthy relationships with food. you should move and fuel your body because you love your body not because lockdown is ending and you need to rise to this social norm of ‘hot girl summer’ you only have one body, it’s deserves to be loved no matter shape or size back again with my fave @zara dress this time in blue can’t wait to style with a white shirt and sandals in summer but for now with my fave mules i can’t take off x three instagram influencers walk into a bar... ...i know this because i just saw their story. been playing with this over the last few days. full thoughts to come soon. @lumeneuk nordic-c pure glow cleansing balm. today’s outfit for a lunch walk with my friend and today‘s photographer @irisha.usv i prefer to take pictures while seeing friends and killing two birds with one stone. if nobody’s around i also take pictures on my own with autotimer. how do you work?

watershot with my jumbo acwell licorice ph balancing cleasing toner products description acwell licorice ph balancing cleansing toner jumbo size with as much as 300 ml, twice as much as the original! a popular toner that has taken the world by storm due to my high content of licorice water and peony extract which together remove red pimples and brown pigment spots. it gives a lot of moisture and glow to dehydrated skin. in addition, it acts as a cleansing toner that ensures that the skin more easily absorbs products in the rest of the skin care routine. it also contains green tea which is a powerful antioxidant that provides deep care for tired and sagging skin. free of alcohol, parabens and perfume. cruelty-free. my thougths i think the toner is good. it provides a lot of moisture and calms the skin. the only downside is that it is a bit oily in consistency. my skin does not completely tolerate products that are oily, because it becomes more oily. otherwise it smells very good and it is quickly absorbed into the skin. i use this most in the evening. bespoke order frame colour gold frame size 7x5” swipe for more photos introducing the first of our frames using our gold foliage this is perfect for that extra special gift, be it from me to me, or for someone you love! this particular order was for a birthday gift mother’s day is just over 2 weeks away, so make sure you get in touch asap if you are interested in purchasing something from us as a gift! we’ve posted all of our deadlines for mothers day orders on our stories today. head there for all the info you need! happy wednesday instafam!⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ remember to be kind, everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle...⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ girl, you can do big things! go for it! study mode: on if you need me for the next two months i’ll probably be in front of my laptop trying to work my little butt off working hard for my future, to create the career and life i want and deserve for myself whatever you’re working towards, no matter how hard, do it for you “you’ve changed” “i’d hope so” strong women not only feel pain, they accept it, they learn from it and fight through it. they turn their wounds into wisdom. they may fall, but they always get back up, dust off and fight like they have never fought before strong women drop a comment and manifest yourselves spring is coming avec ces températures printanières j’ai opté pour un chemisier à fleurs et un blazer corail de chez @mylookfeminin vous aimez??

anyway, i think it is finally time for me to share my thoughts on @imfromglobal ginseng serum. i bought it back in the summer because i really wanted to introduce ginseng to my routine for its antioxidant and antiaging properties. unfortunately, it is not a winner for me. this serum contains red ginseng and panax ginseng seed oil. its texture is on a thicker side but still absorbs pretty well. it has an odd smell which isnt too bad for me, but if you are avoiding fragrance, this might not be for you. i have been using it for months now and sadly have seen no improvement in dullness or healthy glow. it gives me minor plumping but thats about it. i have seen literally everyone rave about it and i m so sad it did practically nothing for me. i ll probably try the @beautyofjoseonofficial one next to compare before i give up on ginseng in skincare altogether... what is your favourite product from i m from?? sandalwood vanilla wax melt sandalwood vanilla wax melt evokes a combination of both the natural aroma of indian sandalwood and the sweet scent of vanilla. this fragrance initially exudes a strong and prominent smell associated with bergamot and freesia. top notes: bergamot, freesia middle notes: lilac, clove, cedarwood base notes: white patchouli, creamy sandalwood, vanilla bean we recommend a single burn time of 4 hours per cube but you can re-melt a cube many times to continue to enjoy the scent. each snap bar will provide a minimum of 20 hours burn time. 100 vegan cruelty free biodegradablerecyclable packaging highly scented natural soy wax happy hump day this week has absolutely flown over for me so far because work has been manic looking forward to some well needed time off next month! feels like it's been aaaages since i last posted, what have you all been up too?! who’s already booked off the weekend of the 21st of june? gassed at the idea of being in a club with my friends getting sweaty and dancing till the early hours of the morning. almost feels too good to be true @glen.foo happy finally got to try the @dr.altheaglobal moisturizer and their new blackhead nose patch!! i think the moisturizer is a new holy grail for me :o 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐥 𝟑𝟒𝟓𝐍𝐀 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐑𝐞𝐩𝐚𝐢𝐫 𝐂𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐦 $27 50ml the key ingredient of this moisturizer is resveratrol, an antioxidant that boosts cell turnover and improves elasticity. the ointment like cream targets fine lines, acne, and acne scars and soothes sensitized skin. overall, i loved this moisturizer so much! it has a pleasant floral scent and gel like texture which is perfect for my oily combo skin. everyone is confused between this one and the 147ha cream because the names seem to suggest that this is for dry skin and the other for oily skin, but it’s actually the opposite! this was lightweight to not cause excessive oiliness but also moisturizing enough as a night time moisturizer with a thin layer of a sleeping mask. i enjoy using it both day and night and will definitely repurchase in the future 𝐁𝐥𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐡𝐞𝐚𝐝 𝐙𝐞𝐫𝐨 𝟐 𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩 𝐍𝐨𝐬𝐞 𝐏𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡 $15 4 sets before y’all freak out, this is not the same as the biore pore strips that literally strip your skin!! there are 2 sheets fo this nose patch, neither which are stripping. the first step is a sebum softening sheet mask like strip that gently extracts blackheads and sebum trapped in your nose area. then you use the cotton bud to swab away the sebum and the other tip of the cotton bud as an acne extractor too! and finally there is a pore tightening strip also like a sheet mask that is the final step. i saw almost immediate results after using it, but i don’t think the effects are long term and using a chemical exfoliator would probably be more effective in shrinking pore size. however. it was really satisfying to use and i found it to work really well! the waste created is not ideal, but it’s a quick fix for extremely clogged pores and shows immediate results. thank you dr. althea for sending these my way! prgifted in exchange for honest opinion 10 converse 10 ways i still can’t believe i picked this table up for only £5 at bm a few weekends ago. i hope everyone’s keeping well, some rough dates to get us through the last push now i hope!

the pandemic pushed me to start looking for ways to keep myself busy and accomplish some of my goals in different ways, such as growing my poshmark instagram! what is one thing that the pandemic pushed you to do that you might not have done before?! also, this cardigan necklace are both from @milaraeboutique and my code emilyrenee will save you 20 sitewide! nothing better than a new pair of crisp jeans coh are my favourite jeans, what are yours? instead of being so harsh on yourself, try loving yourself for a change! we spend so much time listening to two voices in our head: the one that tells you how awesome you are, the one that motivates you and pushes you to do more of what feels right and there's the other one too the one that tells you 'you're not good enough', 'you're not working hard enough', 'you need to do better' what you water grows so water your plants wisely. we keep saying these awful things to ourselves over and over again. we compare, we judge, we manipulate, we underestimate, we misunderstand and undervalue. why don't we just start.... treating ourselves with respect, our bodies with love and mind with compassion. be proud of how far we've come and what we've overcome. invest in ourselves and our wellbeing. appreciate our hard work and the fact that we are just trying to do all we can to become the best we can ever be. be there for yourself. be your own best friend. excuse me while i go cry telling mummy off for being cheap with treats as apparently he doesn’t feel he has had enough when someone asks what’s my favorite color. i’m the queen of “does it come in black, grey, navy, tan?” just give me all the neutrals ok. i do try to incorporate more color into my wardrobe but when ever i’m browsing a store, i always gravitate towards these colors, i know dang well that i’m alone on this. it’s a work in progress do ya thing @prettylittlething @asos @missguided on wednesday, we wear pink!

one of my favourite views over winchester is from st giles hill. from this amazing viewpoint you get to see over the whole city with fantastic views up the high street. you can access the hill from magdalen hill road or quarry road at the bottom of the high street past king alfreds statue. the view is definitely worth the climb. sometimes is just a little bit self-care moment i have not stopped looking at holidays since the announcement so many clients are booking to get away and are getting amazing deals at the moment and i personally can’t wait to get back to exploring so my laptop screen is a constant blur of holidays right now and i’m so here for it... let the travelling begin 𝐑𝐢𝐜𝐞𝐋𝐨𝐯𝐞 ┇𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭 𝐅𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐝 -rice power essence ┇𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐈𝐧𝐠𝐫𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬 -𝐑𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐁𝐫𝐚𝐧 𝐄𝐱𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭: contains minerals, vitamins e, a, b1, b6, and other nutrients that help your skin become hydrated and supple. -𝐈𝐝𝐞𝐛𝐞𝐧𝐨𝐧𝐞: has antioxidant properties 4 times more antioxidants than vitamin c and 10 times more than coenzymes. -𝐕𝐞𝐠𝐚𝐧 𝐂𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐧 𝐟𝐫𝐨𝐦 𝐌𝐮𝐬𝐡𝐫𝐨𝐨𝐦𝐬 extracted from snow fungus: keeps your skin supple and improves elasticity. full list of ingredients at the end of the slide. this rice essence has been a great hydrating addition to my skincare. the texture spreads out like water, sinks into the skin so quickly, leaving a non-tacky hydrated surface. as it fully absorbs, you can feel the firmness on the skin and notice a brighter complexion. it gives the perfect amount of hydration, without making the skin feeling oily or clogged, and it works well in combination with other products. it really feels choc choc just like the brand name. choc choc means well-moisturized skin. thank you @chocchocus and congratulations on your very own product launch!

written on top? yes, probably. especially since it was written in red frosting and all caps so it was a bit creepy. but the amount of fortitude is to be admired, i think, as well as thoughtfulnes; they bought a brand new cake pan and a cake carrier!!! i don't think it needs to be said that i will forever associate red velvet cake with my love. the other day i mentioned to @neurotickitchen that when i'm feeling extra love-y i'll bake red velvet cake for them my partner, not @neurotickitchen in case clarification was needed, but then i realized it's probably been a few years since i'd done so and i should rectify that— especially since our anniversary was coming up, they begged off any more citrus zest desserts oops, and apparently it's been really sad eating half portions of already scaled-down cakes. we were celebrating many years together the other day, so over the weekend, i got up and baked them the red velvet cake from while they were sleeping. the entire, full-sized recipe. i paired it with the fluffy vanilla frosting that was with the vanilla buttermilk cake because they prefer their red velvet with vanilla frosting, and broke out my @nielsenmassey vanilla bean paste like @yossyarefi said to. we finished the whole cake in about 30 hours. hosted by @champagneandcookies and @awhiskandaspoon is baking from snacking cakes this month. this cake is a bit darker with 4x the amount of dutch-process cocoa compared to other recipes. i love it. thank you @clarksonpotter for the free preview copy! the same cake carrier is pictured happy wednesday my lovelies mediterranean chicken, kale again tenderstem broccoli and sweetcorn. lots of protein and micros. happy wednesday my lovelies mediterranean chicken, kale again tenderstem broccoli and sweetcorn. lots of protein and micros. welcome to the world, evelyn! words can’t explain how honoured i am to be apart of these gorgeous announcements! we won’t discuss how broody it makes me either this is me my happy place do you have 𝕥𝕙𝕒𝕥 place where you can chill and just switch off?

hope you’re all having a fab week if we could start again... well, we’re really only at the very beginning but we’re now watertight and had our roof repairs done woohoo so one of the next big jobs is to sort out our staircase! swipe to see the current staircase, it is bizarre there’s an additional step that’s been added at the bottom and carpeted as though the staircase isn’t the right size, it’s extremely narrow and it’s a horrible glossy wood finish. so why would we start again with this if we haven’t even started? well, it’s started the great debate of should we move it elsewhere in the house, should we widen it and move the bathroom wall or even split the bathroom into a main bathroom and en-suite, should we move the whole of the upstairs around? the possibilities are endless and i am losing my head we’re coming to the conclusion that by moving the staircase we would compromise the downstairs and the plans we already have in our heads but we totally understand the opportunity to move it now and create a better space upstairs. so in summary, if i could start again... we certainly wouldn’t have started the great debate about this staircase and just done it quickly, kept it where it was, job’s a gooden but i suppose it’s good to consider all options and ideas day 24 if i could start again @mydailyrenovation took too many photos this day so enjoy some more one of the things i've become aware of in the last year is that being a parent and having an opinion about parenting are two different things. misconceptions and expectations about parenting methods have been roaming around for centuries creating an unrealistic picture. the reality is quite different. here is to breaking a few bubbles of parenting myths and stereotypes i have discovered so far. you will spoil your baby if you hold him too much. oh the amount of times i've been told this one. how do you even spoil a baby by responding to his needs. in fact, it is teaching him that he can rely on you to comfort him. swaddle your baby tightly by his leggs so he is comfortable and sleeps longer. i've actually gotten in trouble by my pediatrician every time i've asked him about this. the legs and hips area needs to be wrapped loosely so the baby is able to have some free movement. maternal instincts are always accurate. nope, not always. my intuitions have been pretty accurate for the most part but a total different story after i became a mom. maternal instincts sometimes may very well be my maternal anxiety acting up on me. not always though, sometimes lol. overprotect the baby. we need to practice being cautious instead of overprotecting our babies as it can do more harm than good by creating many issues down the road. it limits their potential from exploring the world around them as well as hinders their ability to be independent. both the parents need to have the same approach to parenting methods. in a perfect world yes, though it's far from reality. differences are normal but being on the same page and maintaining the core parenting values at the end of the day matters the most. alwsys keep baby neat and clean and germs free. the truth is exposure to germs helps them strengthen their immune system. taking simple precautions such as frequently washing hands is far better than getting overly worried about germs. tell me a parenting myth that you discovered to be false? this post is in collaboration hosted by @little.fingers.exploring and @morethanmumma.dxb idea initiated by @shahnasrahman working from home in maximum comfort the difference a layer of tan makes tho obsessed with the bperfect ultra dark tan, gives the biggest confidence boost ever, applies so evenly and smells unreal yes i know i naturally look like casper lol daily dose of vitamin d courtesy of the large windows in my apartment is there anything better than a pink drink?! yes there is and that is a pink drink full of vitamins, electrolytes, delicious flavour and no sugar! the wonderful @vidrate gifted me some of their electrolyte drinks to try and i absolutely love them! i wouldn’t share products with you that i didn’t really enjoy and these drinks are no exception! the lovely flavours make keeping hydrated easy and i’ve noticed i’ve had a better week with my migranes since starting drinking these! be sure to stay tuned as there is more to this exciting partnership for my lucky followers! 35 weeks just 2 more weeks until i’m full term with baby boy, and 2 more weeks of work until i’m on maternity. i’ve said it several times, but how?! we’ve nearly finished his nursery, but i’m yet to finish our hospital bags wearing my faveeee jeans of all time weekday rowe if you don’t own a pair of weekday jeans, you need too x i’m sorry if you get sick of these pants who do i think i am chocolate makes everything better these crownies are genuinely the most amazing things i’ve ever baked. @hotelchocolat posted the recipe a month or so back and i immediately saved it, i’m insanely glad that i did!! i really wish that we still had some left, but they went even faster than baking usually does in this house so unfortunately i’m going to have to settle for eating peppermint toads to make everything better do you prefer cookies or brownies?

for i will be sharing my first impression of the @aurelineskincare cleansing bars! aureline co is a family-based brand that creates skincare products that are “effective, clean and naturally-derived”. formulated and handmade by phd chemists, their products contain plant based active ingredients, and are free of fragrance and harsh chemicals volcanic clay cleansing bar fights blemishes evens skin texture best for oilyacne-prone skin hemp oil cleansing bar rehydrates skin fights signs of aging best for drymature skin their ingredients include olive, palm, coconut, and castor oil, as well as shea butter and calcium bentonite volcanic. both cleansing bars are formulated with same ingredients except hemp seed oil which is only in the hemp oil cleansing bar. although they target different skin concerns, these bars can be used by all skin types. they have a plush and creamy lather, no overpowering scent, and a slight squeaky-clean sensation after use. each bar retails for $12 usd which is fairly affordable for a clean skincare brand. a downfall for me personally is that i don’t have a convenient way of safely storing the bars in my bathroom. so, in the meantime, the bars are wrapped up in a towel to avoid bacteria i wish they had a soap dish with a cover and drainage system on their website. other than that, i look forward to continuing to use these bars for my acne-prone face and body!

i’m used to going i to crisis mode from, you know, the mental illness, and i never have had to consistently hang on by my fingertips for this long. i’m exhausted. i know you are too. i wish i could tell you that everything is gonna be okay, but i can’t. i don’t know that. but i can tell you this: i know. i understand. i empathize. i’m here for you. i’m proud of you. i know you’re doing your best, and please don’t expect your best to look the same way it did before the pandemic. we no longer live in a pre-pandemic world. and if you forget all of that and just remember one thing from this caption, i hope that it’s this: you are enough. charcoal model is wearing size m and is usually size m. an outfit that i'm wearing on repeat on my daily walks favourite denim style: agolde 90’s jeans competition closed win a bottle of @cocotanuk in a colour of your choice how to enter: comment what shade you'd like: medium, dark or extra dark tag a friend follow our page winner announced this friday 26th i’ve come to realise if you take life so seriously you won’t ever live. so take pictures, try outfits and stay cute no matter if your getting old ‘good things are fucking coming!’ manifest your dreams!

these products can be used on the eyes, lips and face and offer subtle colour that can be built up. their packaging is a paper wrapping that can be torn off as you use the balm more. after using these only a handful of times, i can tell these will be perfect everyday when i want to look put together, but not need to try as hard. they creased on my eyes but with a pat, they can be blended easily again. i definitely want to try more and see if any other colours are more pigmented! sustainability in my products has been something i'm more dedicated to, and love to find brands who embody that. leave your recs down below! missing portland today, such a cute city feeling very inspired by @flairforskincare tonight with my i just wanted to say thank you so much for all the love i've received on my latest blog post chatting about the impact of the spinal surgery i had ten years ago today, it was a difficult and emotional one to write but i've had such a lovely reaction to it. if you haven't had a chance to read it yet you can find it over on my blog. ꕥ don’t forget to wash take care of your hands ꕥ this hand nail cream provides intense hydration with rose oil, centifolia rose extract and concentrated shea butter. ꕥ don’t forget to wash take care of your hands ꕥ this hand nail cream provides intense hydration with rose oil, centifolia rose extract and concentrated shea butter. my bed is my favourite place to be happy vibes today this photo is obviously a couple weeks old because texas decided that it’s summer of all the sudden and while i put the wool coats away and look for sandals, here’s a little about this piece from texas sculpture garden: mac whitney, ‘blanco 1985. it is “about opening up a large flat round steel plate by making straight line cuts through it, and pulling it apart. the plate becomes three dimensional, giving an openness to the sculpture”, says the artist. the large colorful steel sculptures were the first things i noticed about dallas’s architectural landscape. do you like it? this photo is obviously a couple weeks old because texas decided that it’s summer of all the sudden and while i put the wool coats away and look for sandals, here’s a little about this piece from texas sculpture garden: mac whitney, ‘blanco 1985. it is “about opening up a large flat round steel plate by making straight line cuts through it, and pulling it apart. the plate becomes three dimensional, giving an openness to the sculpture”, says the artist. the large colorful steel sculptures were the first things i noticed about dallas’s architectural landscape. do you like it? all style no harry for all my gals out there who feel like they can’t stick to a style or aesthetic: creating is ever changing. it’s an evolution of yourself. it’s a wave with ebbs and flows. ride that wave. see where it takes you. sure, there’s obstacles along the way. there’s dull moments and creative blocks. but stick with it and let change happen freely. remember there is no one like you. explore your creativity. explore your passions. don’t just be one thing. be every single part of you. you are your aesthetic. you’ll find your wave. your groove. your sweet spot. till then, ride it out and take off the training wheels just me thinking about my outfit for june 21st another visit to the park. roman keeps asking to go to soft play with the “big big slide” soon little man; real soon. knitwear x leather is the combo i never knew i needed samples, samples and more samples!!!

i was the caffeine eye cream, jojoba oil and rose water and now they are my new everyday products! i’m all for safe and minimal ingredients plus i love their packaging! i go from two extremes, strong and ready to crush my goals left and completely defeated by my anxiety right. i am learning to accept the ups and downs that my mental health is bringing on because it’s a super crappy time. we have been in this pandemic for over a year and face new restrictions and challenges daily. i am someone that craves normalcy and structure and i have felt so out of control with my routine, goals, health, and work because of this pandemic so i am learning to be a little kinder to myself. something i learned from a course i am doing on the @calm app is by psychotherapist @tarabrach she uses the acronym rain to recognize your mental struggles and give it space and acceptance in your body. with my anxiety the more i suppress it or try to ignore it the worse it becomes. next time you are struggling to keep the negative and anxious thoughts at bay, try using rain to change your perspective. r recognize what is happening and what you are feeling. a allow those feelings to exist. i investigate why these thoughts may be coming up and what could be causing them. n nurture those thoughts with a loving and compassionate touch. life is too short to be unhappy 5 days a week in exchange for 2 days of freedom @steven said something like this. and if you think it can’t be you to break the chain from the 95 you are so so wrong. me guy have 3 businesses between us which can all be managed from anywhere in the world.. even with this backdrop if you’re thinking i want to do more after this lockdown, i want to travel a little more, say yes a little more and just live a little more then drop us a message. we have built a course on how to make money on the move if this shit show of a year has taught us anything, it’s that there is a whole world out there to see. grab every opportunity with both hands as a bloody global pandemic can creep up on you and take a year of freedom just like that. i will be saying yes to so much more post covid. yes to a coffee or 5 thousand gins with my mates, yes to a city break every month, yes to more holidays than ever before, yes to one ‘last’ drink message either me or @guythomas.elevate if you love to travel and want to save money on hotelsflights you want to set up a business that allows you to travel you want to earn extra money we have 3 options up for grabs. it’s not a hoax. it works. it’s that simple even if you don’t like to eat your greens, make sure you drink them this is your daily reminder to smile tell me something that made you smile today perfecting some of my poses for june 21st so hopeful now for the rest of the year now, and can’t wait to make up for all our lost time ps if you don’t know this top from @zara, get to know she’s so cute angles i don’t think people realize how dangerous a “good angle” can be! i love that more people on ig are being open about it though. im also not talking about the people that do the “posedunposed” photos where they’re trying extra hard to make themselves look different. i’m talking about the photos that i’ve chosen to share. 1st photo: i look pretty normal here, normal stance 2nd photo: i popped my hip out a big more and i look extra thicc false advertising 3rd photo: i’m standing straight, no posing. i look very square-ish lol 4th post a video: if you’ve watched my story then you’ve already seen this but you can clearly see how my body changes as i move 5th photo: this is a darker picture and makes me look extra curvy, like i have no excess belly fat i know i do and that’s okay people only allow you to see what they want you to see on ig. a lot of girls aim for perfection which is why apps like facetune are used so frequently. i’m here to tell you that it’s okay that your body looks different at different angles. i’m still happy with how i look in all of these photos!

i began my new job as a marketing assistant with clarins on monday, i have worked incredibly hard to get to this point, the start of a very new exciting chapter in my life! however, my body decided it didn’t want to play ball nor did it want to give me a break. i got admitted into hospital on monday afternoon as my abdomen was incredibly sore and abnormally swollen. they think it’s got something to do with my bowels, they’re still unsure whether it’s endometriosis related or not, but investigations are being carried out to determine the root cause of the problem. i was supposed to have a ct scan with contrast today but that didn’t happen so i’m hoping it goes ahead tomorrow i’m naturally a hard-worker, i’m conscientious, and i have ambition. not even a day into my new job and i felt like i’d let them down. guilt started running through my veins. i felt embarrassed. i felt useless. but, then i just reminded myself unfortunately whatever is going on inside my body is out of my control. i can’t help being ill. i really couldn’t have asked for my manger to be anymore understanding and she’s being incredibly supportive which certainly has helped me not feel so racked with guilt. being in hospital is difficult at the best of times but even more so at the moment. not being able to see my mum and dad just to take my mind off things is bloody difficult i have only being in hospital since monday but it feels like weeks! i’m keeping my fingers crossed i don’t need to stay in for much longer as all i want is to be at home with my family and sleeping in my own bed thank you from the bottom of my heart to everyone for all of the well wishes over the last few days, the kindness and love from this wonderful community never ceases to amaze me helloooooo friends woke up in such a mood today. i feel so energetic, not used to this. probably the full nights sleep. also go me, i’m wearing new sunnies!

i was lucky enough to get to try the @biolage volume bloom hair line. the volume bloom line is for fine hair and meant to gently cleanse hair and provide lightweight volumizing shine. i have to say i love the shampoo and conditioner. it leaves my hair smooth and shiny. i’ve noticed my hair has more volume even just letting it air dry. when i blow dry my hair, i get nice volume that lasts all day. these have a nice scent and they do not leave my hair knitted after use like other products have. the mousse is just okay to me. it expands quite a bit when dispersed into my hand, but i found that it’s easy to apply too much product in my hair. when this happens, my hair gets a bit crunchy. i do think that this provides a little extra volume boost, but i only see myself using this when styling my hair for an eventnight out. i wouldn’t use this daily. overall, i’m really happy with this product line and am seriously considering changing this to my everyday shampooconditioner. if you have fine hair i recommend giving this a try. thanks @influenster and @biolage for letting me try these. thoughts are 100 my honest opinion. prgifted tonight’s dinner was delicious! do you add supplements into your routine? lately i’ve been using @doseandco pure collagen powder in my morning coffee so i’d thought i’d give my opinion on the topic. personally i don’t think they are essential in your routine, that being said i do enjoy adding them in to give a boost to my skin as much as i can! i’ve tried other forms of collagen supplements in the past and i like this one the most. i’ve also tried more from the @doseandco range and have been pleasantly surprised from the taste. you’d expect collagen supplements to not be tasty but both the chocolate fudge collagen protein powder and the vanilla dairy free collagen creamer are delicious! i’ve added them to smoothies and coffees and i love them. benefit wise this particular collagen powder contains bovine collagen which consists of a combination of both type 1 and type 3 collagen. this is known to be responsible for the growth and repair of skin, bones, tendons and ligaments. sounds impressive right? so basically when you take this bovine collagen supplement, your body takes the amino acids, vitamins, minerals and collagen molecules from within the formula and delivers them throughout the body to areas in need of a little extra collagen formation, like the skin, hair and nails. now there definitely are better people to seek info from if you’re after advice on whether you should start taking supplements, i highly recommend speaking to your doctor first too just to be safe. however, i can vouch for this one as i have definitely noticed more strength in my nails over the last couple of months. i’d love to know your thoughts on supplements? pr product but opinions are my own curly hair don’t care fendi roma all of our items are now available on our website link in bio cute simple necklace is 16'' long plus 2'' extender very limited amount of charms!!

here’s a quick insight into the reasoning behind the name for this magazine today’s look brought to you by @pearl.boudoir.indiana such a fun day doing a boudior session with vanessa can’t wait to see the pictures i realized i never posted this shot of my go-to morning routine, except i ran out of the vitamin c serum already... ...but i have a replacement serum lined up and i’m so stoked to try it out! @beliefusa aqua bomb jelly cleanser ph 5.5 relief toner @kiehls powerful strength line reducing concentrate @mujiusa moisturizing milk @heimishcosmetic marine care eye cream @kravebeauty the beet shield out of all the products listed above, the muji moisturizing milk is i think the only product y’all haven’t seen on my page before. and that’s because i only reach for this moisturizer in the warmer months. it gives me just the right amount of hydration needed on humid days. {they also have other moisturizing milk with different levels of hydration} the product itself: it’s very liquidy, almost like a serum consistency, and smells citrusy, like an orange or tangerine. in terms of ingredients...i bought it in asia way before i knew what any ingredient in skincare meant. i can’t even read the packaging, it’s all in chinese or japanese though the weather is starting to get warmer in san diego, i might use this as a body lotion moving forward because i’ve had it opened for a while now believe the ingredients aren’t as effective anymore. this makes me think about any poor choicetiming i’ve made on opening products. opening a “winter” product during the end of the winter season or a “summer” product near the end of the season. maybe i should fly to the opposite hemisphere hello australia next time i catch myself doing so. just excuses to travel lol. lastly, have y’all heard that muji closed their stores in california i’m so sad. i loved window shopping at muji. coming soon our website is almost up and running, we hope you’re ready! make sure your turn on our post notifications to be the first to hear when it’s live things i’m still learning: taking a break doesn’t mean i’m a failure. growth can still be found in stillness. it’s important to patient with myself while adjusting and adapting to new things. give myself grace not giving my mind time and space to recharge is unproductive. in february i’ve really learned to slow down more and really enjoy the down time. i’ve connected more and taken breaks more, drank a ton more water and just been more present. i’ve been spending less time on my phone and being way more intentional about the time i do spend on it. it’s felt really amazing honestly!! what’s something you’ve learned this month?

here’s the deal: your contractor isn’t a designer, and neither are you, which leads to my number one tip: 1. create a plan this may sound basic, or like common sense. but let me caution you—it’s easy to buy one off items, especially if they’re on sale or look cute in the model mock-up at the furniture store. before you know it you’re frustrated because nothing flows or goes together and you could’ve utilized your money, energy, and time in a smarter way. listen, i love a good mood board a.k.a. a fancy term designers use to help determine the mood of a room swipe right and you can see one i’ve created for our kitchen you can include a lot in your mood board, but what’s most important is your color theme. because it’s the foundation of everything. like when you see that cute pillow, stunning work of art, patterned drapery and anything in between—you lay it on the mood board to see if it works and flows with the entire room. now that’s the mood board, to get even more detailed you can create a floor plan andor a 3d rendering to get a really solid visual. sounds like a lot of work? it is! and this isn’t the half of it...that’s why god made interior designers! mood boards are kinda my thing and i’m becoming more obsessed with design by the day. any questions you have that i can answer?

or you’re trying to stop smoking but you imagine the taste of a cigarette? the subconscious can create so much resistance to change and this is exactly why we need hypnotherapy! can't believe how much brighter the room is since we painted it. we changed all the skirtings and architraves from cream to white. we painted all the wood in the house cream when we moved in feeling like a stranger things extra mornin mornin as part of my freelance side of nursing i do several things alongside my day job. check me out giving some careers advice for a harris academy. one of the largest multi academy trust of schools in london. thanks for asking me to be a part of the careers talks @80sjaykay i think it's so important to encourage and engage our young people at their stage of thinking about careers and nursing as an option. nursing is endless and isn't just about bedside hospital work as once perceived. this is the 3rd time this year i've been approached to do a careers talksession with either a primary school or secondary6th form. if you too would like me to give a careers talk or careers qa on the role of a children's nurse or school nurse to your primary or secondary class then please contact me via email. good news is with the current climate my service can reach out to any school in london and the uk using zoomms teams until visitors are allowed back in schools again. full youtube vid in bio follow @nurseangiejay follow @nurseangiejay comment, like, share would anyone be into wearing odd shoes for asking for a friend this headband makes me feel like anne boleyn and i am here for it! good morning y'all switched up the look with a blazer are we feeling this look?

that jogger set again set @nastygal x @georginalennon1 banana bread recipe and inspo from @sophiesplate and it did not disappoint, everyone needs to try i topped mine with greek yoghurt, warmed berries and golden syrup🫐 been quiet on here this week, feeling pretty unmotivated, anyone else? roll on spring please i’ve had a few new followers of late so thought i’d reintroduce myself and explain how this blog came about. the rosè drinking mama was created after a rant or two over some rosè of course where i was telling my husband how fed up i was seeing only the ‘picture perfect’ photos and posts about motherhood. how did these mothers always have their shit together!? at the time, i was sleep deprived, struggling to shave my legs or drink my coffee warm, isolated from the world coz...covid and i thought to myself, “surely this isn’t just my reality of motherhood!” it was then that i realised how lethal these picture perfect photos for the right gullible person like myself could be. we aren’t to know what lengths it took to get that one photo! that mother could have been carrying on like a screaming banshee wanting to throttle her kids and husband all morning, but for one moment, captured the perfect picture to brag about how blessed her life is and how totally freakin’ awesome motherhood is 247. motherhood isn’t awesome 247 we all have our moments of despair! and no mother is perfect. we are all flawed in our own little way and that is totally a-okay it builds character! so with all these thoughts while i was deep in rant mode, lined with a double meaning, the rosè drinking mama was born. i mean yeah obviously i love rosè, but it’s also a nod to the fact that i am by far perfect. i drink, i swear, i overindulge on carbs instead of poached chicken, pomegranate and quinoa salad who even has time to make that shit seriously!!!, and i am never going to hide it. yep, not your average run-of-the-mill ig milf sorry guys! we as mothers have the hardest yet most rewarding gig in the world. there is no point warping perceptions of reality to make other mamas feel any more inadequate than they probably already do in some moments. let’s face it, if you wake up for that child, love them unconditionally and keep them safe, what better job could you really be doing? all the rest is just fluff. is doing what you love!

if not whats your favourite jewellery brand? dark or light academia? how about both? i am so excited for day one of with my fabulous co-host @beccaworewhat i just couldn't pick one of the two aesthetics story of my fashion life so here is what i like about both: dark: you know i love a slight edge in my look, so the black feels like home. this vintage blouse has a kick ass collar that print clashes nicely with the vintage mixed-pattern cardigan light: plaid is one of my favorite prints, and these wide leg trousers are perfect for the academic look. i went with this chunky turtleneck sweater and vest to change up the neckline from the dark look eagle eyed friends will notice the same metallic oxfords in both look because they are such cool shoes so which way do you sway? or do you like both like me? coming soon 4 days to go until launch day! we are so excited for you to try our improved and super soft joggers and jumpers. will be available in six colours and size ranging from uk 4-16. be ready to click that order button on www.thatssominxi.com spring launch tonight at 8pm!!! how sweet is romans’s new whimsical bee tee from @otisandbo i love the colour the material is so soft! one of my new favourites on him! use our code wildrose10 for 10 off sunshine well this is freakin’ exciting! @cocoabrowntan perfect fade in medium throwback to a lovely family portrait, wonderful grandparents and their brilliant grandkids. its such an honour to capture the love they share with each other. confession- this isn't my cup product review this is the @officialmedik8 hydr8 b5 intense. if you have followed my page for a while you will know that i love this brand and one of my favourite medik8 products is the hydr8 b5 serum. i’ve repurchased it so many times, and i thought the time had come to try the intense version. medik8 describes this product as “our original hyaluronic acid serum supercharged” the first difference i noticed was the colour of this serum, it is a gorgeous purplepink colour and that comes from the inclusion of saskatoon berry. rich in antioxidants the saskatoon berry is a nourishing superfood that protects the skin’s natural stores of hyaluronic acid and promotes a supple complexion. along with multi-weight hyaluronic acid, and vitamin b5, the intense version also includes natural moisturising factors which help to bind water to skin for the ultimate hydration. i find the consistency to be slightly thicker than the original, only slightly though, and as with the original my skin absolutely drinks this up! in fact it is so fast absorbing, that i recommend using it on damp skin. so i spritz with a mist first and than pat it into my skin. so the verdict...i love it!!! my skin is instantly hydrated and plumped and i will definitely reach for this over the original if i feel like my skin needs that extra hit of hydration, so i already know that it will be a firm favourite in the summer months. this is priced at £55 with the original coming in at £40. to be honest, i think i’ll have both serums in my stash boujee i know and use them according to my skins needs at the time...although i love the intense and certainly notice a difference in levels of hydration both instantly and throughout the day, i’m not quite ready to let go of the original. i’d love to know what your favourite hyaluronic acid serum is...let me know in the comments! counting down the days 𝐻𝑎𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ 𝑎 𝑐𝑜𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑒 𝑖𝑛 𝑚𝑦 ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑑 first dress of the year dress: @isawitfirst shoes: @carvelaofficial i love spring blooms all the colours coming back to life after winter what's your favourite thing about spring??

just wanted to say hello and thank you to all of our lovely new followers and existing ogs so here's a quick face behind the account post i'm charlotte, most people call me char, i'm 25 and live in the north east of england with my fiance steven, 27. we're first time buyers and moved in at the end of january 2021 it's been a total whirlwind since then! i'm currently working from home, which is doing nothing for my online wishlists and shopping carts but it's been lovely to spend so much time in our new home. steven and i will have been together 4 years in july, but have known eachother since 2014 we live in a 2-bed upstairs flat, 10 minutes drive from the beautiful coast we're extremely lucky to have fantastic friends and family helping us through this whole process and couldn't have done it without them! we really hope you enjoy our posts and are looking forward to getting to know you all! lots of love, char etude house in today’s post i wanted to share some of my favourite sheet masks of all time. these are the @etudeofficial 0.2 therapy air masks which have been around for some time now. the name of the masks comes from the fact that this mask is only 0.2mm in thickness which is the thinnest sheet masks i’ve used. it’s made of a natural vegetable cellulose designed to stretch to fit every face shape and it literally feels like a second skin. they come in over 20 types depending on your skin concern and each of them come in either a water, ampoule or emulsion type essence. i’ve tried most of the different types and enjoyed them all. since i have dry skin, i really like the green tea and hyaluronic acid ones in particular! they are also super affordable and can be found at many asian beauty websites joining in for the first time but with a different take! these beautiful boxes deserve some loving moments. and hang on! weekend is just round the corner!

have a shower. sounds daft but i think as mums we can see the plethora of things ahead of us that need doing and forget to start our day right. jump in the shower, wash your face and do your skincare. it takes 5 minutes but can lift you completely! write a list. include everything, from getting up to showering to taking 5 minutes for yourself. crossing things off a list gives you a sense of accomplishment and will motivate you to do the next thing! get some fresh air. your brain needs it! a few deep breaths of clean, crisp air make the world of difference if you have jobs to do from a computer or desk, clean the area. a tidy desk a tidy mind. take the pressure off, set goals but know that if you don't accomplish then today that's fine!

pov: you’re my three hour lecture that seems to never end hi my name is christina and i’m addicted to coffee. it all started when i had my first child 14 years ago. i believe it was caused by many sleepless nights while trying work full time and still run a household, oh and did i say i was only 21! coffee was there for me when i got home. coffee was there for me when i was sad. coffee was there for me when i was happy. it was always fresh and hot, it never let me down. haha okay now that you think i’m ridiculous, what do you put in your coffee and how long have you been drinking it? i feel like it’s a mom staple like how would we survive?? i have the answers i seek. honesty over everything. blt for lunch today bacon medallions, beef tomato, iceberg lettuce, lighter than light mayo 0.5 syn and a schar brown ciabatta roll hxb. lovely xx @slimmingworld hi it's time to give your hair some ayurveda care!

i double cleanse and enjoy switching cleansers around but my 1st cleanse choices would be an oilgel based which takes away all of the traces of dirt, make up and impurities. some of my favourites are @oskiaskincare renaissance cleansing gel i cannot not get over chwinter kit package for this @deciem squalane cleanser and @muradskincareuk prebiotic 4-1 multi cleanser. for my 2nd cleanser i like a more creamymilky texture, my most reached out and more favourite would be @katesomervilleskincare goats milk and delikate soothing cleanser and a simple @firstaidbeauty pure skin face cleanser. what are your cleanser preferences? bacon, brie and cranberry panini why not upgrade your bacon bap by adding a wonderful spread of cranberry sauce and brie cheese, which has all the needed qualities to not only melt to perfection but is sooo delicious bake then tuck in and enjoy you in?? recipe in bio am vs pm picks! @farmacybeauty daily greens oil free moisturizer is my favorite daytime pick. it’s lightweight oil free gel that melts into skin. this doesn’t pill when you layer your spf, plays well with makeup too. the natural scent is pretty strong though, it took some getting used to. katesomerville delikate recovery cream is my everything! superrr thick, balm-like cream packed with ceramides complex peptides to reduce redness and strength the skin barrier. it’s perfect to use by itself or as an occlusive over other products. i’ll repurchase this forever! what do you use for ampm products?

use the link in my bio to check out my new post how to stay on track plan. if you go into training without a plan you are more likely to fall off track than if you were to have a plan mapped out. whether you make a 6 or even 8 week plan, chose the right program for you. this means you stick with the same thing for those 68 weeks and you keep track of your progress. this is where you will see results. for example if you start week 1 on 30kg on the lat pull down, up the weight reps each week so you are progressively overloading. even if you are adding the smallest amount of weight or just 1 more rep it’s still more than you did last week. my current programme is a 6 week plan which i am coming to the end of this week which i am currently training upper 4 times a week and lower 2 times a week with 1 rest day.⁣ from next week i will switch up my plan and change it to another 6 week programme⁣ if you are struggling to plan your own programme drop me a message and i can help update upper body is getting stronger⁣ p.s excuse the patchy tan wearing @bmbleshop haze leggings, code katy10 for money off low-key this looks delicious a very exciting order arrived today can’t wait to share with you all soon image @pinterest blinded by the light blinded by the light you glow different when you doin better. overcoat jacket @boohoomanofficial love the quality dailyfashionlooks the journey so far... this is what goes on behind the creation of our star product. i tried and tested out several formulas before finally finding the formula and product that i found worked the best. i really can not wait to more details withh you soon! ask me anything here's another beautiful shot from @matthewthompson, part of his very moving 'humans of the pandemic'⁠⁠ thank you matthew for capturing these portraits and thank you scott, and all paramedics for everything you are doing!⁠⁠ be sure to check out the full gallery, details below.⁠⁠ scott, a paramedic with west midlands ambulance sevice. scott is one of 67 nhs staff i photographed across george eliot hospital during the covid-19 pandemic first wave.⁠⁠ humans of the pandemic features portraits and thoughts from many roles incl. doctors, domestics, maternity, mortuary, nurses, pathology, pharmacy, physio, and surgery to name a few.⁠⁠ see the full project gallery on my bio @matthewthompson, or humansofthepandemic.co.uk⁠⁠ which is your favourite photo?

on thursdays we wear yellow why is it so hard to get a nice photo with a 2 year old. it’s a please watch my igtv i posted for a full instructional videos. reposting image and details of the products. productprice: @lovemyora facial microneedle roller system 0.25mm $30 how i use it: sanitize your roller with rubbing alcohol. let sit for 5 mins. next rinse the roller with hot water and let it sit for a couple minutes until dry. optional follow up with facial numbing cream if needed prior to using the roller. use the roller as directed. roll according to the box going in “t” and “x” up to 5 times all over your face. once completed you’ll want to use a serum. one that one focus on your main skin concern as the roller will help the serum soak into your skin further. pros: i love the fact that this is quick as easy to use. it’s a .25mm which is not deep so it’s not painful at all. i use once a week or even once every two weeks and it doesn’t irritate my skin at all. cons: it’s a longer time period than if you were to go to a dermatologist but for the cost it’s worth it. keep in mind you should only use it up to 15 times before you need to replace it. overall result: i’m going to continue to use this roller until i’ve met my max limit on use. it’s totally worth the cost! keep in mind to be safe about using this tool. too much pressure could result in creating new scars. microneedling treatment is to generate new collagen and skin tissue for smoother, firmer, more toned skin. have you tried anything similar to this or gone to do a full facial derma-roller process with a dermatologist? back at it🪞 motivation comes and goes. i've been so consistent and motivated to train lately, and hearing that the gyms will reopen on april 12th hopefully made me even more motivated! however, motivation for posting and being very active here on instagram is low. dunno why, i guess i just need a break from time to time. family, work and studying takes time, and i'm a person that don't do stress. so if i feel like something is stressing me, i stop and take a deep breath. i will post and be active when i feel like it, and be quiet if that's what i want to do. in other words, i'll do me⁣ hope you're all having a great week⁣ give yourself permission to rest. can’t even explain how happy kobi and @allaboutmoo are about going back to school but i think this picture says it all!! i forgot how hard it is to dress for the right weather in the midwest it went from 30-60 degrees in less than 24 hours! shop my look! 1 shop this look with your liketoknow.it app 2 download the free @liketoknow.it app and follow me @clarehostetlertang 3 shop my look here! http:liketk.it39bom or 4 screenshot this photo to shop similar looks! @hollisterco @zara how to care for your jewellery part 1 1. no chemicals please! the best thing that you can do for any piece of jewellery is to limit its contact with chemicals. tarnishing and erosion of a metal occurs when the surface comes into contact with a damaging chemical. these can be present in anything from soaps, cosmetics and perfume to chlorine and even some peoples sweat! ️most commonly, pendants become tarnished as a result of excessive perfume and hand creamsgels are often to blame for tarnished rings. unfortunately, it is really hard to predict exactly which chemicals will interact with your jewellery in a negative way, so the best thing to do is limit the exposure as much as possible. basically, jewellery should be the last thing you put on and the first thing you take off ℙ𝕣𝕖𝕥𝕥𝕪 𝕝𝕚𝕥𝕥𝕝𝕖 𝕝𝕒𝕕𝕪 𝚃𝚘𝚍𝚊𝚢'𝚜 𝙾𝙾𝚃𝙳 here are my shoes, take a walk, and talk to me when you get back pampas grass big thankyou to hannah at @mycherrytreehome for this little big delivery of pampas last night which a friend of hers has in her garden and she asked if i wanted some now to dry it out and think about where to put it! l o v e b i r d s wow what gorgeous weather we are having today. can’t beat the sunshine to help give everything a brighter feel. these two gorgeous little birds made an entrance into our hallway today and i just love them! im feeling much more chirpy sorry today and just generally more positive about the weeks to come! soon we will all be able to fly our nests and explore the world again! we can do this gang! another step closer. birds @nordicnest bench @dunelmuk wicker vase @dunelmuk name me a better colour combo dreaming of being in here i have springified is that a word?

i have talked to too many, i repeat, too many near dear ones, who shared how difficult, confusing, and lonely their journey of new motherhood was despite being surrounded by other women. certainly having a baby is supposed to be a joyful occasion and one that someone “should” experience happily but it’s not always that blackwhite; because it “should” be, moms have difficulty talking about this instead suffer quietly in their head. this isn’t a character flaw or weakness; it’s a complication after birth caused by an imbalance of hormones. it can also be due to a lack of support or other stressors. i’m not a doctorcounselor but what makes me livid is when i’ve heard other women who may not have experienced this, lack compassion pass off ignorant remarks. genuinely ask how a mom is feeling, physically mentally ask how you can help even if it’s in the smallest way possible; e.g. offer to watch the baby so they can take a quick shower or nap. offer compassion, comfort an open mind just listen don't tell moms that they are being “ungrateful” or “overthinking” it. don’t tell them your sob story; a person’s pain has to be addressed before they can feel empathy and connection to your story especially if it happened three decades ago don’t make remarks on how much weight they’ve put on how they can quickly lose it if you can’t be a compassionate ear, know this, move along. if you can’t be a source of positivity, then just leave. ita dosa dosa time southern indian crispy thin crepe made from rice and lentils and cooked to order, served with sambhar and coconut chutney. jump on @deliveroo just eat to serve up some dosa's and get your order in for the weekend or call us on 0161 257 2525 or go to our website to get 20 off orders over £25. www.jaipurpalacerestaurants.comfallowfield l i t t l e c u b don’t let that happy little face fool you, we’ve had tantrums galore today!! we also enjoyed a lovely two mile walk around town with grandad! i feel so much better for the fresh air and feeling the sun on my face!! i love peachy orange blushes! still searching for a beautiful bright matte orange cream blush. the fenty blush has shimmer and is more sheer, otherwise that would have been perf! if you have recommendations of a matte orange blush let me know today's is all about them spring vibes the sun was shining when i woke up this morning and it made me so happy ps blurred the background of the second photo cause we have washing on the line top -@georgeatasda jeans- @marksandspencer trainers @asos bag @primark coffee table decor absolutely love that we finally have some sun shining in through the windows!! ariel, who?

actually thinking of making pasta tonight... it’s slowly becoming a tradition of every thursday night i’m not mad about it haha pizza or pasta ohh my love for charlotte tilbury beauty products will it ever come to an end?

it absorbs so nicely into the skin and is cooling upon application as well. i definitely feel that my skin is more plumped up after a dose of this serum! the only thing i would change is the packaging— the opening of the serum is quite wide and has no stopper, which could lead to significant spills if knocked over and that happened to me once @theinkeylist peptide moisturizer is a newbie in my collection! i’ve only swatched it on my hand once but i already think i’m gonna like it based off its texture and moisturizing feel on my skin. i initially thought it would be an alternative to the first aid beauty ultra repair cream, but this one has a thinner consistency, a little more lotion-like! also this was kinda unintentional but i just realized as i’m typing this out— these are kinda a dynamic duo! @skincarebyyourstruly tag after all, you should always seal in the hydration from your ha with a good moisturizer!

may need a record player myself so i can steal this vinyl empty 37: cerave eczema creamy oil it's still winter, which means my eczema is still in full ruin-your-day mode. i've been doing my best to keep it manageable without much success, and decided to give this a try since i have apparently not yet tried the entire cerave range give that time though. for context, my skin is dry overall and i'm prone to eczema on my body, especially my neck and hands. one note i do want to make this has been reformulated since i purchased this, so what i'm reviewing here is the old formula. you can still get the discontinued formula online, but i haven't tried the new one yet. with that being said, this is intended to be a jam packed cocktail of hydrating and soothing ingredients intended to be used on compromised, extremely dry skin. it contains cerave's trademark blend of ceramides to help repair the skin barrier alongside humectants like glycerin and sodium pca. it also contains soothing superstars like niacinamide and allantoin, alongside antioxidants like grapeseed oil and avocado oil. like all cerave products, this does not contain added fragrance, which is particularly important when dealing with compromised skin conditions like eczema. this has one of the most fascinating textures of anything i've tried. it comes out as a thin liquid and it actually feels like it thickens up when applied to the skin. i applied this to compromised skin as needed and i found that this applied with minimal irritation which is difficult with eczema and did a fantastic job hydrating and soothing that area. this left a shiny finish after applying, but i didn't find it to transfer overly much and it sank into my skin well. it was soothing, hydrating, and frankly everything i needed when my skin was going through it. overall, i quite liked this. i'm very likely to try the reformulated version of this, and i'm hoping it's just as good because this was amazing. if you have eczema what's your go-to treatment for it? 55, would repurchase if not discontinued. product cost: $17.99, yearly running total: $568.08. image id: white and red squeeze bottle sitting on an outdoor wooden table. the midnight library by @mattzhaig is my next read!

here's a little motivation to my gals to train upper body outfit: @vitaeapparel @gymshark @whitneyysimmons @flirtypineapplescrunchies @templ.fitness you are your biggest priority yesss read that again boo! it's so easy to go through the motions of every day life and forget that we need to really evaluate how we're doing. believe me or not, you can create the best version of yourself once you let go of things that no longer serve you and let in things that make you feel like you. self love is not easy, if anything it takes the most difficult decisions that we all fear making because we're too scared of the outcome. but i promise you that you'll just be one step closer to living your most authentic life, for you! yesterday i took a walk out to dumbo. did i have work to do? yes. even on my walk i felt unworthy of taking some time to myself. but guess what? i felt present. i felt more like myself. i felt motivated to go harder with my fitness journey. i challenge you guys to do something that's truly for you, instead of doing something out of fear or obligation. i love you guys and im truly here for you. happy friday eve! the category is.... 1 skirt, 2 fits! which is your fave? i’m all about the spring vibes now so it’s definitely the first for me with some chunky trainers and a takeout coffee obviously this is my worried face. i am worried because meowmy hasn’t given me a treato today. maybe i will never see a dried cod bite, a turkey dreamy or a chicken liver stick again. halp. fluffy hair don't care a jumper without a coat?!

that along with the glorious weather we are having at present has me so excited! i personally can’t wait to get all dressed up and go out again! @zara have dropped some absolutely amazing summery pieces this week, this top is stunning for a summer night out!

none of my usual arty foodie shite in the background because i wanted to keep it simple and let the tart shine made a steak pie last week that i'm sure i will post eventually and had leftover pastry. you know your gal hates food waste, so i turned the leftover shortcrust into a tart! blind baked the pastry, cooled it and then filled with marscarpone mixed with lemon juice, zest, vanilla, icing sugar, and double cream. artfully arranged berries on top, sprinkled with zest, wolfed down a large slice. so bloody easy but it looks so good! love you, mean it @musetheagency i have a thing for oversized blazers i have a thing for oversized blazers sometimes i just need a big bowl of greens but i refuse to let anything i eat be boring bbq ranch chicken salad ummm yum! one of my best pieces of advice is not to overthink what you eat, just listen to your body.it will tell you what it wants, so give it to it. sometimes it wants a cookie and sometimes it wants a salad keep in mind that your body works hard for you everyday, so treat it with the respect it deserves no good salad should go without some delicious protein! protein is always the main ingredient in all my salads! that’s what’s going to help keep you feeling full and energized if you learned anything from my stories last night, you know i love pulled chicken, so that’s exactly what we have here! pulled chicken tossed in @primalkitchenfoods bbq sauce, on top of fresh arugula and loaded with some extra veggies. drizzled with my favorite @primalkitchenfoods ranch dressing @sietefoods lime chips! i love making big fresh salads for a quick lunch or dinner! they’re quick easy, and always delish imo. plus this pulled chicken just makes everything better! how to how to make pulled chicken: 1. turn your crockpot on low for 8 hours or high for 4-5 hours. you can always also let this simmer on the stove all day if you don’t have a crockpot. pour in 2 cups of @pacificfoods unsalted bone broth, 12 chopped onion, garlic clove, and 1 to 1 12 lbs of organic chicken and let simmer in pot for 4-8 hours depending on if you select low or high. 2. remove chicken from crockpot and pull apart using two forks. toss in your choice of bbq, ranch, buffalo, or enjoy plain! 3. add to salad, quesadillas, sandwiches, whatever you so choose! best pulled chicken evvvvvver. yum! i’ve been obsessing over chunky boots lately what’s something you’ve been loving recently? just some of the things to prepare you for becoming a parent: make a hot drink, leave it for an hour and then drink it cold. learn how to walk up the stairs like a ninja, making 0 noise whilst the child sleeps. put on freshly washed clothes, then get them covered in anything and everything within 0.2 seconds of wearing it. make yourself food then share it, leaving yourself with a mouthful of leftover sogginess. clean and tidy your house then pull every single toy out on the floor while dropping biscuit crumbs everywhere. put on little baby bum nursery rhymes all day and then sing them in your sleep. pack everything you think you need, plus double for a small outing. go to the toilet with an audience. then you’ll be about 20 prepared. but the love you’ll get in return outweighs it all and that’s why we keep going. and at the end of the day, the happiness of your mini human is what makes it all worthwhile right? @happinessbelgium @vonkfoto @catglammua contente the tights and boots are the real in these photos!

if you know someone who has good story tag them here!! these stories will always remain anonymous if you would like to send one in please dm us or email us at howweseeitpod@gmail.com one of the best parts of being norah’s mom is that i have been given no other choice than to slow down, take a deep breath, and appreciate the small things. finding the joy in the journey is something i have always struggled with and it was a mindset shift i desperately needed, albeit one that took some time. today for i was tagged by the lovely @sherylpasamonte to talk about milestones! when you’re all done here head on over to @joyintheextra and follow the loop! milestones look different for every child, but when you have a child with any type of developmental delay they can look a lot different. watching your child struggle to meet milestones that come easily to their peers can be painful at times and leave you wondering what more you should be doing. but, when it’s our child’s turn, that milestone is that much sweeter. we take nothing for granted. in this family we celebrate every victory. each hurdle overcome and goal met makes me beam with pride and want to shout it from the rooftops because she has worked so hard to accomplish it. and, while i did not embrace this initially, savoring the slightly slower pace of her childhood is such a gift that we have been given. in this family we know that milestones do not equate with worthiness as a human being. and while this may sound simple, our culture has a lot of catching up to do in this regard. milestones are milestones and we will get there when we get there, but the joy and the beauty is in the journey along the way! being a special needs parent can be challenging at times, but it also has so much beauty and so much extra that only we get to experience and we love sharing that little bit of extra that with all of you! thank you for being here! guess what y’all my shopping ban is almost over i made it an entire 2.5 months without purchasing a thing well almost ...i did buy one bag @ispyfashion it felt good to actually save some so i pledge to shop responsibly going forward. if you’re like me want to do the same, here’s a tip...using cards like @navyfederal cash rewards where you’ll receive 1.5 cash back on purchases can really help! you can then use the cash back you’ll earn towards paying down the card balance! and with features like no annual fees no balance transfer fees⁣ not foreign transaction fees⁣ no cash advance fees you can shop with ease! now who’s going shopping with me @christineandacamera this outfit gives me @kristincavallari vibes yep, i edited that wall in an absolute hurry i ain’t even sorry how do you like your coffee are you an ice coffee drinker or hot coffee lover? i love both and to be honest it depends on how much time i have in the morning! if i’m not in a rush i’ll take the time to make a fresh warm cup, if i don’t have time i’ll just pour myself a cold cup from the fridge! if you have a coffee lover in your house and looking for the perfect gift for them swipe to the next slide for a few ideas! my personal favourite is the artisan coffee sample pack or a great coffee grinder! all items as always linked in @liketoknow.it and the link can be found in my bio! hope this helps inspire some ideas for you as you shop for birthdays, easter, mother’s day ect!

i know i have a few things for sure. i love zara. that’s the thing. “a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...” i did it all in a pair of air forces @shop.dreamgirls happy thursday everyone i wanted to share my thoughts on the @evelom cleansing capsules because i have a lot to say. first of all, the packaging it was my first time using capsules and i have to admit i found it hard to rip that little tip off without accidentally squeezing the capsule and wasting all that oil onto my hands. maybe i’m just clumsy or maybe other capsules are easier to use but i found it really messy. from a sustainable point of view, this is such a waste. the capsules are 100 biodegradable, but is it still necessary to have product in 2 types of packaging just for the aesthetic? at the end of the day, this still provides more waste from all of the capsules and the jar so i’m not sure if it’s really worth it even if the capsules are biodegradable. they wouldn’t have to be if they wouldn’t exist in the first place now to the actual product itselfi was afraid there wouldn’t be enough oil in a capsule for a cleanse but it actually was! the oil feels super luxurious and spa-like but god that smell it was so strong and fragrant and not particularly nice. for me it smelled like medicinal plants and it got to the point where i genuinely had to hold my breath while cleansing now the website says the oil has botanical oils. is this just a fancy term for essential oils or are they genuinely different, someone please enlighten me all in all, i would not recommend this product. the smell was too strong for me and i’m still not sure if the capsules are nice enough to compensate the fact that they are wasteful y o u d o n t t a k e a p h o t o g r a p h y o u m a k e i t ansel adams happy thursday insta gang, i’ve been busy making bits for the house so thought i’d share my diy candle holders and textured painting vintage wooden tennis racquet collection ca., 1970’s scrambled egg and smoked salmon on homemade sourdough with pretty avo flowers on the side who else is missing brunch, where will you go first once it’s safe to do so?? motivation i’ve had a few people ask me lately how i stay so motivated to workout, or where i find the motivation from. trust me when i say i am not motivated all the time some days there is nothing i want more than to just sit in my pj’s all day, watch tv and eat a load of junk food. but i know that doing that would only make me feel bad, it would make me want to restrict myself the next day which would just lead to a downward spiral. so at the weekends i make sure i relax and loosen up a bit more than in the week. i try my hardest every day and that’s all i can do. today has been a very unproductive day it happens sometimes here’s a few tips on how i stay motivated find motivation on days where i may not be feeling it: wake up and put your gym kit on straight away i do this every morning, that way i think to myself “i’m already in my gym kit, might as well workout” even if i don’t feel like it. find motivation from others, i personally use the @toneandsculptapp and i cannot thank them enough for the community they have created for all of their users. @krissycela has done an amazing job, and there are so many girls i speak to daily you know who you are, ily that help keep me motivated to eat well and workout. create an instagram to keep you motivated, i used to be scared to do this, but i got past it and it has helped me so much!! i have found people through this app who help me so much, and to see them doing well makes me want to follow their lead! a couple of my favourite accounts atm are @w.bethfitness @lucyroseburns @fordbritney lastly, don’t put too much pressure on yourself, if you need a day off, have one. there’s no shame in it, and it won’t set back all the progress you’ve made sneakers swipe left pour voir les backstages de la photo ahah kdys youth information will help you apply for your irish passport by providing you with the correct details you know. looking to be an active citizen in ireland and own your own passport. we are here to help for more information contact youth information online. little plates always look so appetising but i’m always thinking will it be enough. luckily there is always more to hand just incase the munchies get me. crispy yet tender and juicy pork belly in a lovely sweet sauce accompanied by green beans and broccoli stems. follow @recipeezy for more delicious treats to make you eat. thoroughly enjoying this leopard and blue combo today both second hand, natch. first time matcha latte first time matcha latte to this outfit because the sunshine makes me happy! plus it’s almost friday! looking forward to some sunshine and non-freezing temperatures this weekend! happy friday eve happy thursday! this is my first with some new products that i’ve tried and some of my all time favorites @farmacybeauty melt away cleansing balm paraben free makeup remover and face cleanser. i really like using this to remove makeup and when i want to double cleanse @soldejaneiro brazilian bum bum cream- helps visibly smooth and tighten the appearance of your skin. love the smell of this, once you open it you can smell the notes of vanilla, salted caramel, and sandalwood @drunkelephant protini polypeptide cream moisturizer filled with proteins and nutrients, it replenishes and restores your skin back to a strong, healthy state. this is my go-to nighttime cream @farmacybeauty honey potion renewing antioxidant hydration mask- an intensely hydrating honey face mask for a glowing complexion. i’ve used this a few times and have had a great experience with it @drunkelephant lala retro whipped cream- this cream provides replenishing barrier support by reinforcing the skin’s acid mantle and defending against the effects of everyday stressors. it is very nice for tired and dry skin! i enjoy using this in the morning and nighttime this week the girls have loved their ball pit from @theplaytimecompany swipe for the best noise in the whole wide world happy thursday can't believe it's almost march but at least spring is coming for the oats 60 g oats 25 g whey raspberry @myproteinuk 160 ml water microwaves the oats with the water, stir, add the whey mix with a little water to help diluted and microwave for another minute. toppings with raspberries blueberries @lindtuk chocolate amandes pour le porridge 60 g de flocons d'avoine 25 g whey framboise @myproteinfr 160 ml d'eau mettez l'avoine avec l'eau 1 min au micro-ondes, ajoutez la whey mélangez avec un peu d'eau pour aider à diluer, mélangez et repassez 1 min au micro-ondes. toppings framboises blueberries chocolat @lindtfrance amandes 505 cals 56c 15f 31p dreaming of warmer weather who else??

i haven't even gotten through half of the bottle yet so you're getting your money's worth. i'd give this a strong and genuine 1010. are you guys physical exfoliators or chemical exfoliators? you can shop @dermalogicauk 's products by clicking the affiliate link in my bio gifted skinfluencer this leather piece is so easy to wear with sneakers. it can be belted to give it more of a fitted vibe as the dress is over sized in style which we know isn’t everyone’s cup of tea. whilst playing around at our shoot we also styled the dress as a jacket, wear open with your dark skinnies and our new woven store charcoal polo neck. social media ideas for the music industry swipe left for content ideas 5 things we like to put in woven baskets...⁠ 1. plants 2. blankets⁠ 3. cat toys⁠ 4. yoga blocks straps 5. our baby how do you guys use yours?⁠ these are some ways we shame children that we may not even be conscious of. especially if we experienced a lot of this type of shaming when we ourselves were children. children soak up every single thing we say to them. some go as far as saying our words become their inner voice. be mindful of how you speak and engage with children and notice if you see any patterns with how you were parented this is definitely what i want to be doing right now having a huge pile of our favourite snacks a lovely bottle of wine or two, snuggling up having a harry potter marathon️ that is definitely first on the list of things to do when we can finally see each other again i know it’s still a long time still, but there is light at the end of the tunnel now we’re getting closer day by day! i love you so much 𝗛𝗲𝘂𝘁𝗲 𝘀𝘂𝗰𝗵𝘁 𝗶𝗵𝗿 𝗱𝗶𝗲 𝗖𝗮𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗮𝘂𝘀! die besten drei kommentare werden fixiert und bekommen ein shoutout in meiner story. ich bin gespannt! speichere diesen beitrag, um mich zu unterstützen. hello everyone! the weekend is near. do you have any plans?

how are you all doing? it's almost friyay! at the beginning of the month i shared this look on my ig story but i wanted to dedicate a post to it. february is the month for chd and the color is red! so i went for a little red wing paired up with a bright red lippie. if you wanna know more about it: https:www.cdc.govncbdddheartdefectsfacts.html about 1 in 4 babies born with a heart defect has a critical chd also known as critical congenital heart defect.1 babies with a critical chd need surgery or other procedures in the first year of life. thinking of my girl @momlifemakeup and her family. if you don't know or follow ashley, i highly recommend you check her acoount! she's one of the best out there and i'm so glad i've met her. love you girl hope you're all taking care of yourselves baby bettie. i'm pretty sure this was my first ever lesson on her she has coming so far! business on top definitely loungewear on the bottom to my younger modeling days. i had an interesting conversation with my daughter on our car ride home earlier this week. we started talking about her wanting to come to work with me to see the babies i used to work on the motherbaby unit at the hospital.that conversation lead to her telling me all the things she wanted to be when she grew up. as i listened to the enthusiasm she had in her voice and saw how her eyes lit up as she thought about all she could be when she grew up, i felt an overwhelming sense of gratitude for my parents. my parents always supported and nurtured every dream and aspiration i ever had. when i told them i wanted to be a modelactress at an early age, they researched invested in that dream. while i am not a world renowned model or actress today, i have had some pretty awesome experiences throughout the years and most importantly i fully understand the importance of nurturing and supporting my children’s dreams. to my sweet children, dream big and mommy daddy will provide the tools to help you make those dreams a reality. i can't wait to be doing my @byonikuk facials again. this is a throwback to when i was open inbetween lockdowns. here is the lovely @sophiechurch having one during her pregnancy. byonik laser is safe to have during pregnancy so no need to stop your regular facial treatments. also, something you may not know, although we are using a laser, it is painless and many of my clients have found it very relaxingand some have even fallen asleep @jakequickenden14 if you would like to go on the waiting list for this treatment please email me at carla@skinrenewalclinic.co.uk who loves settling down with a good book? and who folds down the corners of their page to save where they’re up to? tut tut if you’re one of these naughty people you should head over to our etsy page and treat yourself to a bookmark in any colours of your choice eggplant parmigiana an italian classic!

living the glam life in the face while i’m sat in my dressing gown gorgeous muse @sararaouf in her custom ‘margot’-inspired necklacebracelet set and ‘felice’ ring. this necklace and bracelet were based on the original ‘margot’ necklace design see my design archive for details but i changed up the clasp on the necklace and used a slightly thinner curb chain for the bracelet!

selfie moment♡ bangs update: almost non existent, they grow out so fast just saw these dig a little deeper questions on pinterest, and thought it would be really interesting to answer. do you prefer writing with a black or blue pen? would you prefer to live in the country or city? if you could learn a new skill, what would it be? do you prefer baths or showers? do you prefer reading paper or electronic books? what is your favourite item of clothing? do you like your name? would you ever change it? i'll go first blue pen, rn country post pandemic city, speak cantonese and mandarin fluently, baths, electronic i love my @amazonkindle, @vessi everyday shoes, love my name fun fact i'm named after a character from one of my mom's soap operas lol. let me know your answers below the best colour for the best place the shade brighton is undoubtedly my favourite from the new @mavalauk pastel fiesta collection and it’s not just because brighton is somewhere i’m missing most in lockdown. the bright pink violet matches the quirky city, whether it’s the bold beach huts, candy floss on the pier or winding laines where you can pick up all sorts of bits and bobs. i’m also wearing my ring from @poshtottydesigns based in brighton which my pals got me for my 30th birthday to tie in with the whole brighton vibe. i can’t wait to get back down there! [22] mom jeans and cardigans i am here for causal vibes how many pairs of sunglasses do you have? i sold a few pairs and got it down to 5 now that i absolutely love. i've been trying to marie kondo

coming a pastel shelfie to brighten your day i don’t know about you but this week has been a week of ups and downs. i’ve definitely felt my emotions get the better of me but i did remind myself that

feeling down today, but the sunshine has finally peaked it’s head from the clouds and it’s feeling a bit more springlike and joyful! i drove to the shops earlier, for some stuff of course, but also just to get out and clear my head. but i went out in a cardigan, had my sunnies on and drove with my window down. all of that plus seeing the blue sky lifted my spirits completely! so just a little psa to get outside and get some sunshine, you deserve it after being stuck indoors for months on end. here’s to the lighter nights, some sort of normality coming back, and springtime magic is just around the corner edits, edits and more edits this is from early last year i think when me and @ceriboots180 went for an adventure thankful for a sunny day thankful for a sunny day team matcha or team coffee? drop a for matcha or a for coffee below! pictured: iced honey lavender matcha latte w oat milk french vanilla cold brew we're seeing more sunshine and warmer weather ahead. get your spring shoes ready update on the new succinic acid spot treatment by @theinkeylist |pr| the color is a really pretty rich emerald which is fun, but it doesn't really 'rub in', so it is probably best under a mask or used overnight. unlike a kaolin based treatment, it has ha, so it doesn't dry down hard. it's very flexible. i wear oils at night, so it has smeared off while sleep. i polled everyone a week or two ago, and 100 of you said i'm crazy for saying it causes a burning feeling so, i find if i put a thick dot on the spot without rubbing in, it definitely tingles for 5-10 minutes, but if i rub a thin layer, there's no tingling. also, i keep hearing that it doesn't have a scent, but it's strong of sulfur to me the 6th ingredient aside from water. i will say that it does seem to have an effect as far as not allowing the pimple to get worse. but i'm not sure if it improves it in most cases. maybe not getting worse is technically improving? anyway, i'm not a dermatologist, these are just my thoughts. i'm grateful to @theinkeylist for letting me try out some of their products @amika amika kure bond repair shampoo conditioner “our revamped repair line is here to rescue your strands from everyday heat, environmental stressors, chemical treatments, and more.” first of all the packaging is the cutest! i love the colors and for some reason it makes me feel like a kid again i’ve used this

e d e m o the first time we've ever been inside our house, and i was so nervous, but what can i say?! it is phenomenal here's a little preview of our kitchen... our options are absolutely stunning and everything has come together so well! considering how fast they have worked to get us completed quickly, they have done an exceptional job and, although we'll do a detailed look for snags tomorrow, on the surface, the quality and workmanship seems to be incredible if i love it this much now, imagine how i'll feel when the flooring is all in next week! roll on tomorrow for completion p.s. there's still 1 handle to be put on, the eagle eyed among you will have spotted it... qotd: is your husbandso unaccustomed to seeing you wearing makeup my husband is products in the photo: doll skin anti-stress skin perfector in light-medium $38 this foundation is perfect for everyday use especially if you are like me who has lots of skin issues going on acne, hyperpigmentation, redness, dryness, etc. because this is packed with soothing ingredients, namely turmeric extract, cucumber extract, licorice root extract, aloe vera extract, green tea extract, chamomile extract, magnesium, vitamin c, lavender flower extract, and many more. this feels more like a cc cream to me than a foundation because it is very lightweight. the coverage is buildable, but i personally just apply one layer of this foundation and i am good to go. it instantly brightens energizes my face. it gives a natural look rather than looking like you have foundation on my skin can breathe. it doesn’t break my skin out.⁣ however, the light-medium shade is too light for me. i think medium or tan shade will match my skin tone better. i still use it all the time though because my skin loves it. doll skin t.c.e concealer in light $28 this concealer offers really nice coverage. it is creamy but glides well on the skin. perfect for hiding those dark circles dark spots. it is also skin nourishing just like their foundation. but despite all of that, i honestly haven’t used this as much as i wanted to because the light shade doesn’t suit me. 2 the point double-ended eyeliner in cafe noir mocha $24 each i love these eyeliners so much it just made my life easier. this eyeliner has two ends; one for outlining one for defining. i mean, it is just so perfect for someone like me who’s an eyeliner challenged i’d say. these are really pigmented. i personally think that these are way better than my stila eyeliners. overachiever precision microblading pencil $24 now, i don’t usually do my eyebrows but when i

flatbreads and roasted mediterranean veg we bought 2 lamb shanks a few weeks ago for a sunday roast then realised there would be too much meat when you factor in all the accompaniments, so put one in the freezer to use it up i made the gordon ramsay slow cooked fiery lamb shanks recipe. the recipe includes lots of herbs and spices wine fresh chillis etc and was really nice i also did some simple mediterranean veg and some homemade yoghurt flatbreads which are so quick and easy .i brushed these with a herb butter which i made from some @schwartz.uk lightly dried parsley which i bought when i couldn’t find any fresh parsley these packets are a good way of getting that fresh herb taste without having to use up a big bunch of herbs before they go off. really enjoyed this tea and liked that i could prep a lot of it on my lunch break and slow cook it in the afternoon. spicy lamb shank homemade yoghurt flatbreads and roasted mediterranean veg we bought 2 lamb shanks a few weeks ago for a

post! alot of people this week have been talking about “toxic positivity”. the meaning of toxic positivity is “the assumption, either by one’s self or others, that despite a person’s emotional pain or difficult situation, they should only have a positive mindset”... it is totally normal to try and live up to someone else life. but, the reality is instagram only shows a portion of people’s lives. what they want you to see. the positives of their lives. please remember that when scrolling through this app. that is all, have a lovely evening!! my heart is so full rn! thank you for all your love

of fun to draw on walls, doors and windows if you stand or kneel on a soft surface such as a pillow this makes the activity more challenging and works on your child’s micro-balance. i have been doing a @domestika course on beginner drawing lately. taught by the talented @punodraws and after one of the doodle classes ella was so excited to try some of his patterns, so i got out our favourite

@stylemejilly @thewardrobeedituk @thestylebee @mumwithoutamum @thestylebubble a while ago we cooked creamy garlic chicken using a @pinchofnom recipe and it was delicious, when we did it the first time we did it with leeks, cabbage and a big portion of chicken. i knew this would be perfect in the future with something like pasta and i massively craved this meal so we cooked it again! we cut down the portion of chicken and got rid of the cabbage but we still had leeks, cream cheese, garlic and chicken stock. we also bought some fresh fusilli form asda, it's easy to cook and i actually love how spirally their fresh fusilli is. i massively recommend this meal, it's rich, it's garlicky, it's creamy, it's delicious. it's not a colourful meal but it's that type of meal that you say mmm outloud to and that's always a good indicator to me that the food is great! and it's pasta! pasta is the best! i swear i wore that outside and didn’t just put that on for a photo! these days i barely find the

message me for more info afternoon tea i know technically it's not afternoon but it was when i took this picture! the past few weeks have been tough for people for different reasons. i can't say i have enjoyed the juggle of teaching from home and teaching at home but we have had some lovely times. brunch and afternoon tea have become regular occurrences. having a while off the hamster wheel of commute, work, home, bed after almost 16 years hasn't been all bad. p.s no fancy cupcakes here. we went old school with butterfly buns and jam and coconut! they were delish. @shareyourfamilyhome @caringtoshareyourfeed got these super cute sets from @hm and they are the comfiest sets in the world, perfect to mix and match so i’ve been keeping a little secret! we are excited to announce that we are expecting our first baby, due on the 1st of september my birthday! just out here doing my thang. the sun hits different leading up to summer i can’t wait for the longer nights to begin we’ve nearly made it guys. here’s to the last stretch blogger another beautiful day has been and gone got more washing on the line and more fresh air in my lungs friday tomorrow! hope you all have a lovely evening! another type of memory sharing my @maccosmeticsuk lipstick collection mac lipsticks are so iconic. you know what your getting with them, super creamy, long lasting, and very rich in colour. these were such a hype back in the day, but over time i’ve definetly not reached for these as much as i used to, especially since the liquid lip craze. but i much prefer bullet lipstick these days so i hope to get a lot more use out of these. my personal favourite would probably have to velvet teddy, i’ve been through so many of these. it’s best described as a deep tone brown with a matte finish. it’s definetly one that would compliment all skin tones. another favourite of mine is in the shade fresh brew. this has a lustre finish which means it has a shiny finish. it’s sheer to buildable. it looks like a gloss. but is creamy like a lipstick and minus the stickiness of a gloss. shade names from top to bottom viva glam ll brave spirit hug me velvet teddy faux whirl fresh brew viva glam what’s your fave mac lipstick, i feel like there’s always one i havn’t heard of? @maccosmeticsuk @maccosmetics my first lv bag still looks are good as new !!l i think i want to get a matching strap i don’t cary very much so i’m not too worried about the chaps since it will be rarely used that way but i want to have a little more options where do you recommend nice interiors don’t have to cost the earth. a lick of paint can make all the difference. our nursery furniture was either gifted from friends or got on @donedealie but by painting them all the same colour, they look like a set and they’re actually from mamas and papas. i think most furniture should have a second life if they are still in good nick. do you agree? girls go to college to get more knowledge hello yellow! took a lil break from the rainbow to focus on school, so it seems only fitting to show you my beautiful campus! if you didn’t know, i am currently a ucf rosen college student studying hospitality management and this is the cute little campus. i my school! what iswaswill be your major? gooey s’mores brownie loooove inspired by a video sent to me by @shivqni but using my own recipe! brownies with nutella and

bites?! very nice indeed, thank you” so foodgasm bites it is!! best feeeback i’ve ever had tbh the layers are on our stories but it goes like this: brownie mixture nutella marshmallow fluff brownie

this morning but the flat faced photo bomber got in there first. have a relaxing evening nobody told me that when i got a puppy i’d have to pick up her poop and put it in a bag and take it with me to the vet at some point but that’s what i’m doing today. also nobody told me i’d be wearing sandals in february a week after a snow storm but here we are. this is how i imagine chilling at home in vs how i really be. if i wanna change it up i lay down and put my legs on the wall i got a ton of kdramas and anime to catch up on this weekend and i cannot wait. what are you guys currently watching?

shouldn't. our bodies cant always handle everything we throw at it and we should listen to it when it tells us to take a step back. it doesnt mean you've lost strength just that your body doesnt have

sort of songs in the same beautiful way?! i’ve spent my whole afternoon listening to their arrangements of pop punk music which would definitely be the soundtrack for jane austen’s emma and i’m entirely obsessed with them. the pandemic needs to end soon just so that i can go to a castle in a ballgown and dance to these songs if you watched bridgerton, what did you think of the soundtrack??

i’m going to briefly describe the highlighted ingredients and give you my thoughts. so the 15 vitamin c is formed from a mixture of eac ethyl ascorbic acid, thd ascorbate and magnesium ascorbyl phosphate. i know, i know what does that mean. to put it in a more simpler way, these are packed antioxidants that will also help diminish dark spots to the skin, boost collagen production and protect your from free radicals. it’s non-irritating, but i think the key thing was that they added magnesium ascorbyl phosphate that increases hydration on the skin and has calming factors. so less irritation is possible with this form of vitamin c although you should always do a patch test and honestly using the term “non-irritant” is relative.. anything can be irritating to the skin, some skin types just experience it more often. yerba mate guayusa when used topically is a form of caffeine to the skin. yerba mate is between a cup of coffee but more than a cup of tea, while guayusa is a great coffee alternative. the caffeine is going to help stimulate blood flow, tighten the skin, give you all the good anti-aging benefits, depuff the skin and help repair any damage caused by environmental stressors due to the antioxidants. passion dragon forms of vitamin c and antioxidants. this bottle is an antioxidant powerhouse. i didn’t experience any irritation and my skin felt so hydrated with it. it felt sticky initially but i just changed the way i applied it. the skin felt bouncy, it gave me a glow but did not help me with stubborn pigmentation. i feel like i would have to repurchase it a second time to notice a difference with pigmentation. but $68 have you tried this product? are you going too if you haven’t? @youthtothepeople huge appreciation post to @perfectlyimperfectcandles i came across this page a few weeks ago and i’m so glad i did! such a lovely person behind the business too. look how beautiful these candles are. i absolutely love them and cannot wait to add more! quick snaps while waiting for my „food to go“ get cooked. these were dreeeammy navy, white and gold is so classy i love it always close to the sea learning is... these days learning is pretty much zayn driven. she decides everyday what she wants to do and we do it. this morning she grabbed her box of math manipulative, came and sat down on the carpet. we then proceeded to learn about fractions check out stories and then played with intelligence sticks the picture for some time. once she was done, she packed up the box and put it away. and then onto the next thing it was... what does learning look like in your home?

many people who suffer from food sensitivities will likely be told to avoideliminate the food altogether. this may help stop your gas or bloating in the short term, but when it comes to health, the long game is what really matter! elimination isn’t the answer. if it’s a plant your sensitive to, it means your microbiome lacks the microbes that produce the enzymes glycoside hydrolase that break down that specific fibre. if you eliminate that food completely, you eliminate that specific food for those microbes. they’ll be starving and reduce in number- and this is bad. diversity of species in the gut predictor of good health. what you want to do is veryyyyy slowly reintroduce these specific fibres back into your diet- low slow. by doing this you give an appropriate dose to these microbes that are weak, so they can fully digest what they’ve been given. they then grow stronger, increase in number, and by doing this approach over 4-8 weeks you have rehab’d your gut! want to learn more about gut health and why it is something we need to focus on, no matter what our goals?

available in a4 and a5.⁣ please message or email to inquire and order truffle roasted cauliflower risotto with prosciutto might just be my new fav recipe inspired by @jamieoliver i'm being intentional this year about unlearning lies i have worn as truth for so many years...and i love that for me. there are so many lies that adults told me as a child were true because they believed them too that i still believed as an adult. i was having a conversation with a friend and i realized the importance of being very intentional about unlearning things in our adulthood and relearning the truth. so many things we learnt from 'elders' were passed down from generation to generation and are simply lies, propaganda by governments, personal convictions andor extremities read pharisee-like church leaders that were sold as doctrine etc. if we don't take the time to unlearn the lies, we continue to approach life and situations through a very warped filter. as i grow older, i am deciding to be diligent in evaluating my faith beliefs, nigerian history dynamics, finances other life issues and i want that for you too. today, check your convictions and trace them to when you started believing them, and then evaluate to ascertain if they are true or not. read, talk with people who think differently and evaluate the facts for yourself, expand your scope, learn history, read your bible. we must continue to evolve intentionally. did you catch my stories earlier?

i didn't lose myself in motherhood, i found myself after having sasha, my world sometimes felt upside down, a lot had changed, i changed, our life had changed in so many ways i felt lost. as a new mum i couldn't just do all the things i used to or be the person i once was. this feeling wasn't familiar to me, i'd say i've lost myself, i've lost me. to some extent that's true but since having maevah i've also started to realise actually i have found myself, i'm not lost. being in lockdown has made me realise what i do actually enjoy rather than the pressures of society making you think you love things you actually don't. motherhood comes with a whirlwind of emotions no one can prepare you for, but if lockdown and being a mum again has taught me anything it's who i really am. who i want to be, what i want to be, who i want to be around and what i want to do with my life. feeling blessed and grateful for my girls, i made them but they made me whole midweek motivation on a real note, i’ve been feeling really uninspired to create lately and have been experiencing screen fatigue big time between online classes, zoom meetings, emails, interviews, etc. i’m trying hard to unplug and take breaks anyone else ready for summer break yet? lol i took a few days off...i’d like to say to refresh and look after myself butttttt i’ve just been researching restaurants with got outdoor seating and booking places to eat come 12th april.⁠ who else has already booked?⁠ ⁠garlic prawns⁠ ⁠camino kings cross, london, uk 30092020⁠⁠ ⁠there is one thing my spanish class is good at it’s the names of food. with our classes on line we took the chance over summer to catch up over tapas and of course gambas were ordered! these were those perfect buttery garlicy prawn that make my mouth water just thinking about them. roll on summer for more catch-ups and tapas⁠ clear skies ahead. things are looking up for me lately, but full transparency: it’s been a long time coming. my instagram might be happy all the time, but my behind the scenes reel has come with many challenges lately. it wasn’t pretty. how are you?

𝙂𝙝𝙤𝙨𝙩 𝘿𝙚𝙢𝙤𝙘𝙧𝙖𝙘𝙮 𝙂𝘿 is a clean skincare brand whose philosophy is based around 3 principles: a higher standard of clean, less chemicals more actives, and accessible to everyone. 𝙂𝘿 𝙏𝙧𝙖𝙣𝙨𝙥𝙖𝙧𝙚𝙣𝙩 𝙂𝙚𝙣𝙩𝙡𝙚 𝙀𝙭𝙛𝙤𝙡𝙞𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝘿𝙖𝙞𝙡𝙮 𝘾𝙡𝙚𝙖𝙣𝙨𝙚𝙧 $24 what immediately caught my attention the first time i used this was the smell! it has an overpowering citrus scent that i can’t seem to get over no matter how many times i use it. although, if you’re okay with strong citrusy scents, this may be the cleanser for you. i found this to be anti-stripping, semi-hydrating, and gentle on my skin. 𝙧𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙣𝙜: 𝙂𝘿 𝙁𝙡𝙤𝙤𝙙𝙜𝙖𝙩𝙚 𝙃𝙮𝙖𝙡𝙪𝙧𝙤𝙣𝙞𝙘 𝘼𝙘𝙞𝙙 𝙎𝙚𝙧𝙪𝙢 $34 this daily moisture-boosting serum is, in my opinion, comparable to the ordinary’s hyaluronic acid serum. they have the same consistency and i find my skin to be just as hydrated from using this. however, this is priced at $34 which is around 5-6 times more expensive than the ordinary’s serum. 𝙧𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙣𝙜: 𝙂𝘿 𝘾𝙡𝙚𝙖𝙣 𝙇𝙞𝙜𝙝𝙩𝙬𝙚𝙞𝙜𝙝𝙩 𝘿𝙖𝙞𝙡𝙮 𝙁𝙖𝙘𝙚 𝙈𝙤𝙞𝙨𝙩𝙪𝙧𝙞𝙯𝙚𝙧 $28 one of my favorite things about this moisturizer is how lightweight it is! i used this underneath my sunscreen and didn’t find my face to be too oily after and it works nice as a night moisturizer as well. it’s also fragrance free and there’s no discernible scent to it which is a huge plus in my book. priced at $28 1.7 oz, this is one of their more affordable products and i would recommend it for those with combo skin. 𝙧𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙣𝙜: 𝙛𝙞𝙣𝙖𝙡 𝙩𝙝𝙤𝙪𝙜𝙝𝙩𝙨: will i be repurchasing any of these? two no’s and one maybe. the cleanser is great, but the scent is just too strong for me. the ha serum is nice too, but i can’t justify spending $34 on a serum when i could get something as equally effective for 15 of the price. lastly, while i do like the moisturizer, i’ve found similar products that have the same effects so i’m leaving this as a maybe. have you heard of ghost democracy before? prgifted in exchange for my honest opinion ravenclaw this is my hogwarts house and probably my favourite look of the whole series! i was super proud of that cut crease ngl what house are you in? i was never much into makeup, i like my face as it is without anything, but it’s actually quite fun to try something different and that’s what i’m doing here i don’t usually share unfinished pieces in my feed but why not? there’s a lot of work that goes into these babies behind the scenes and i may as well pull back the curtain and give you a little peek. these are baked but not sanded so you can see some rough edges. next is sanding, drilling, and assembly—the less sexy steps of the process imo. click to product tag to see what they’ll turn into when they’re finished! happy friday!! have you seen our new stock? launched last night! go check it out www.winnieandwoo.com so what time is the best time to stroll the streets of santorini? i’ll let you in on a little secret... best time to sea the sights and get those snaps is between 9-10am oia sleeps until about 11am but come too early and everybody has the same idea. the sweet spot is beating the early morning tourist rush and the hour before breakfast you’re welcome! texture i think i’m going with texture thursday now i used the @kiehlsuki avocado nourishing hydration mask and it literally feels like rubbing mashed up avocado on your face. my skin felt so soft and smooth after which would be a perfect base for make up i didn’t wear make up today this is from the advent calendar i had last year and i think it’s a good side to try. i’ve had 2 applications so far and think there’s another 2 in there as it goes a long way almost the end of the week already! manifesting this golden hour light as our days start to get longer i took this picture last year during the first lockdown, but it reminds me how much has changed in a short amount of time. i think i speak for everyone when this pandemic has had a huge weight on our mental health. to cope with the loneliness from not being able to see my friends family, i’ve adapted some of my habits to make a new change in my lifestyle. here are my favourite ones that have helped lift my spirits, and keep me motivated: wake up early and do yoga take my vitamins and drink as much water as i can everyday have a weekly zoom party with my friends and watch a movie use an agenda to plan out my week, and designate little tasks to complete everyday what have been some of your favourite ways to cheer yourself up lately? hope everyone has a lovely rest of their week also can this count as peep the mini scrunchie tower in the back makeup by me @charmedlifephotography everything @foreverandaudrey captures is such vibes thanks for sharing, lovely! xoxoxo spring ready dress jacket both from @sheincurve like most of my wardrobe use my discount code siobhan15 for 15 off @sheinofficial bit of a fail here but this tasted amazeballs!! @rwl garlic meatball recipe. although, ryan bought pork instead of turkey so it made the pan go a little black hence the colour of the courgette oops! but it’s about the flavour haha keep on doing you, in due time the right peopleopportunities will gravitate on a lighter note, can you tell i love anything plaid adgifted today we received our first present for baby it came as a huge surprise to get in from work and open a ‘first wellies’ package, which was kindly by @squelchwellies i feel so lucky to be for this company and to support the growth of this small local business- which is so important in these times. there is absolutely no obligation to post, but we have had a genuine love of all things squelch ever since we bought k her first last summer. we can’t wait to get out as a family of 4 and put these wellies to good use! head over the the squelch wellies website they currently have a flash sale on the squelch packages to grab yourself a bargain! on the hunt for a van so yeah, you could say this mom gig is getting pretty serious dont forget my beautiful boy. this might be a throwback but big ron is either dressed up as some character of the latest film hes into or naked so i can never get an up to date picture of him or get him to sit still it's hard work being a 3 year old! chick’n bacun salad how’s everyone’s thursday going?

what’s your motive it’s a vibe it’s a vibe naily the weekend! a little diy nail job today, fancied a pamper, just can’t do any housework for a week, shame some-day honestly, the only reason i know what day it is, is because my job is keeping me in some sort of, if not dysfunctional, routine. however, exclude the shite weather i'd still think we were in july. time waits for no one. which means we must live our best lives, no matter the circumstances. i seem to have lost myself recently. stopping myself from drowning takes up most of my time at the moment but today i forced myself to stop listen. listen to my mind my body. sometimes, all it takes is a 'click' to realise something isn't right. you may have known for a while but not wanted to admit it. be it a situation you find yourself in, a relationship with yourself or another. sometimes, you fall in love with the idea or something, or someone find yourself unable to see the reality. and it hurts when it's suddenly there in front of you. like a big ole smack in the face. but it doesn't mean you failed because you didn't see it coming. it doesn't make you less of a person because you made a mistake. your journey is not wasted, because you have one day when you're not so keen on yourself. this week has been pretty shitty. in fact, the start of this year hasn't impressed me much. yet on reflection, i am exactly where i need to be. so if you're reading this go stand in front of the biggest mirror in your house look yourself straight in the eye tell yourself it's ok. it is always ok whatever is troubling you, will pass. trust the process. you got this lost is a lovely place to find yourself. couldn't love it more. new wallet from @heedsshoes the same but different @prettylittlething @primark simple fits always do you like cauliflower gnocchi?

no, heck nothing can change those but i did notice less puffiness and a brighter under eye in general. overall they are a bit pricey but i enjoyed the experience of using them and would say they are great for a self-carepamper night. running total: $240 looking back this was such a special day. so many important people were missing which was heart breaking but saying our vows with just a small group turned out to be really special. ad 'all small beasts should have bows in their tails. i feel like this week seems lighter. the sun has been shining that bit more, hope seems to be creeping through the fog of the last year and a cautious optimistic wave is finally refreshing us all. it feels good. we're very proud @hudsonandflo brand reps. these new spring collection hair ties were discounted for us and you can get a discount too with spring10. this day last year we were enjoying a lovely afternoon tea and prosecco at the gorgeous rookery manor counting down the days until we can go out and enjoy a nice meal out again! 46 days incase you were wondering this day last year we were enjoying a lovely afternoon tea and prosecco at the gorgeous rookery manor counting down the days until we can go out and enjoy a nice meal out again! 46 days incase you were wondering another £5 dress. trying it on for when outside opens what i call a healthy obsession a throwback of nyc small towns small shopping always and forever have my @cooperandbaileys is filled with unique pinehurst swag my nc people need to check out asap! never be afraid to try new things this skirt needed to make an appearance on my instagram we can finally announe we have a new collection!!!! gemstone collection you are looking at the amethyst set and the ruby set! shop them now at the website when in doubt, wear red... x: @logaanpaigee 𝙱 𝙸 𝚁 𝚃 𝙷 𝙳 𝙰 𝚈 𝙱 𝙾 𝚈 𝚃𝚘𝚍𝚊𝚢 𝚖𝚢 𝚕𝚒𝚝𝚝𝚕𝚎 𝚖𝚊𝚗 𝚝𝚞𝚛𝚗𝚎𝚍 𝟷𝟺!

𝐅𝐑𝐎𝐌𝐇𝐄𝐑𝐏𝐋𝐀𝐂𝐄 @𝐄𝐓𝐒𝐘 i sharing my experience about the @labnpeople snow2 mela snow sent over by @goryeocosmetics, a calgary based company that ship kbeauty all across canada and all over the world this product is my first venture into microneedle type products. the box contains 1x mela snow ampoule 2x intensive micro carrier -mela care 1paireach 2x after care eye mask1 paireach their functionality is for whitening brightening wrinkle improvement care. you get 2 treatments in 1 box. some notable ingredients both the ampoule and eye ask contains are niacinamide and tranexamic acid. unlike other microneedle treatment in the market,these patches are made of magnesium. you'll see that the needles are very fine and the patch is flexible the hydrocolloid layer is adhesive and help hold them in place. the patches were more comfortable than i expected. you do sense the microneedle pricking your skin a little but the whole process wasn't painful at all. the patches were easy and painless to take off after wearing for 30minutes. it did not left any marks on my skin .i was surprised after this step, i apply the the after care eye mask that i leave on for 20mins the area were i wore the patches earlier didn't burn nor did i felt any discomfort. after all these steps,i didn't have any issue finishing the rest of my routine. in term of results, it's too early to say much. i think you'll probably need to use this regularly to see improvement. though experience wise,this was quite unique and innovative. thank you @goryeocosmetics for giving me the chance to try this innovative product.

lots of countdowns simultaneously on the go. with the end of the 2 challenges i’m taking part of nearing a close and the end of lockdown 3.0 in sight, i’m using this time as a period of reflection. tonight’s 5km run was needed and i wasn’t trying to break any records. i was thinking of how i used to struggle running 2km and now i regularly run in excess of 20km a week. how i would get out of breath just running to the top of the hill outside my house. how i used to hate running overall and now i use it to relax and destress because i genuinely enjoy it. with time, hard work and determination i believe anything is possible. don’t let a bad day or week or season stop you. we all have them and that’s what makes us stronger. keep pushing through because you owe it to yourself we got this fitfam. exciting announcement you might have seen from my stories last night but i am now a @wearecapablelifestyle ambassador @wearecapablelifestyle is a lifestyle brand that prioritises helping women become healthier, stronger and happier!

the boy and i had a seafood treat on my birthday few weeks ago but i just can't get enough oysters. these super fresh scottish oysters were looking lonely, parked all by themselves with sea bass getting all the attention! my heart always goes out to the proverbial underdog and so i had to rescue them. what followed, was an experiment, a tale of chance and discovery, with me pondering over what i could do with these slippery little suckers. and as you can tell, time for me is a luxury, so i abandoned the idea of a bacon oyster stuffing for poussin and went with my gut instead. ok i'm lying, it was a lot easier to mince garlic, ginger, mix with mirin, soya sauce, sliced red chillies and top with chives. it's the middle of the week for god's sake swipe for a close up, enjoy!

hi, welcome to my ig account. my original account was deleted randomly, so here i am, introducing myself to whoever comes my way. my name is cori. i’ll be 31 in march. i’ve been working on my instagram for just over a year and i’m so sad to have lost all of my beautiful, wonderful friends and followers. my account is based primarily around beauty, with bits here and there about my life...and coffee shops. i love a good latte. if you’re here, welcome. i’m happy to have you along my journey. i’ll always be on your team business meetings in some pretty sweet spots today kinda was actually in a conference room but this was really close by mountain dew original eu so i've tried both the uk and the us versions of this before but it dawned on me recently i'd not tried the eu version so i had to grab one from @unclesamscandy use code king30 at checkout for 30 off your order! it's much more smooth and has more resemblance of that classic dew taste than the uk version for sure! still doesn't beat the us version for me anyway! lovecyclingatnightinlondontown such a nice evening with my love @elenapapoui solu-medrol aka methylprednisolone this is a great and effective rescue drug! solu-medrol is a steroid anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid given through the iv. commonly given in the er or inpatient settings. we use this a lot for: severe inflammation or allergies, asthma exacerbations, immune related diseases, severe skin problems, and also used in our oncology population! fun fact: prednisone and prednisolone are not the same! prednisone has to be metabolized into its active form: prednisolone, before it can have an effect on the body. so with this drug, methylprednisolone, it is already in its active form making it work quicker and packs a bigger punch!

we absolutely love this @prada quote. double tap if you too! as of february 25th, just over 220 million people have been vaccinated worldwide against covid-19. the usa alone counts for 64 million vaccinations, and countries like israel and the uae have vaccinated 90 and 58 of their populations, respectively. so why is vaccination suddenly a topic of contention on every dinner table, a heated debate that has arisen amongst even the strongest of pro-vaxxers? to vaccinate or not to vaccinate? the covid-19 vaccine lowdown, backed by science!

this year was supposed to be my 10 year high school reunion crazy, i know haha. but due to the pandemic that most likely isn’t happening. i feel like there was sooo much pressure put on us to accomplish our goals whether it was school, career, or family related before we returned for our class reunion. with social media, i feel like that pressure has kinda been taken off us well at least for me haha because we’re exposed to so many different ways of life that show us there’s not just one path you need to take in order to be “accomplished”. i remember when my friends and i graduated we were saying that we have 10 years to get our lives together. it’s funny because now i’m always saying that you should never put a time limit on your dreams or goals. you’re just adding more unnecessary pressure. i love reading stories about people who didn’t get their big break or accomplish what they wanted to until they were older. it’s just a reminder that there isn’t an age limit to fulfilling your dreams. when i was first looking through the @stormae x @forever21 black history month collection, i came across this sweatshirt and it reminded me of myself! 27 year old amber with my natural hair, head wrap, lounging with my future plants because my current one is dying at peace with herself. it’s a representation of my present day self, content with life and ready for what’s to come did you ever feel pressure to have your life together by your 10 year high school reunion? if you already attended your high school reunion, let me know how it went! i would love to hear this year was supposed to be my 10 year high school reunion crazy, i know haha. but due to the pandemic that most likely isn’t happening. i feel like there was sooo much pressure put on us to accomplish our goals whether it was school, career, or family related before we returned for our class reunion. with social media, i feel like that pressure has kinda been taken off us well at least for me haha because we’re exposed to so many different ways of life that show us there’s not just one path you need to take in order to be “accomplished”. i remember when my friends and i graduated we were saying that we have 10 years to get our lives together. it’s funny because now i’m always saying that you should never put a time limit on your dreams or goals. you’re just adding more unnecessary pressure. i love reading stories about people who didn’t get their big break or accomplish what they wanted to until they were older. it’s just a reminder that there isn’t an age limit to fulfilling your dreams. when i was first looking through the @stormae x @forever21 black history month collection, i came across this sweatshirt and it reminded me of myself! 27 year old amber with my natural hair, head wrap, lounging with my future plants because my current one is dying at peace with herself. it’s a representation of my present day self, content with life and ready for what’s to come did you ever feel pressure to have your life together by your 10 year high school reunion?

i’ve been wanting to blog about lifestyle things since 2010 and yet i didn’t start my first little blog until 2014 ended after 2 years, then my first youtube channel in 2015 lasted maybe a year, and then on and off again thoughts of starting it all back up until 2020. so what happened? i put other things above this. it’s easy to push aside things you want to do or things that are good for you and it’s even easy to get started, but it’s 10x harder to stay consistent. well after all these years, i’m making a promise to myself to be more consistent and continue putting myself out there because it makes me happy and scratches that creative itch. so i leave you with this put yourself out there, write what you want, design what you want, dance like no one is watching, sing like it’s nobody’s business. it doesn’t have to be perfect because it never will. forget about judgment and instead just enjoy every bit of it because you are doing it and you are happy! easy meditation if you wanna get out of your head the devil doesn’t wear prada, she wears pink 𝗢𝗻𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗜 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝗮𝗹𝘄𝗮𝘆𝘀 𝗯𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗱 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝗮𝗹𝘄𝗮𝘆𝘀 𝗴𝗿𝗮𝗯 𝗼𝗽𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀 𝘄𝗵𝗶𝗹𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻.

it just hit the website, tap to shop just enjoying another happy day today! i feel like this past year holy cow it’s already been almost a year since a lot of our lives changed there’s been a lot of sad days. so lately i’ve been focusing on the good and making days happier! i think something that can help you have better days during this crazy time is to find pieces of normal that you can hold on to and really enjoy. for me, it’s watching a tv show or a movie with my family. or it’s creating a routine that i stick to that makes the day feel like a regular day because let’s be honest, we could all use some more regular days! i’ve been working to find those pieces of normal, and i’ve found it to make my days feel so much better! even if it’s boring, i just like the fact that it feels like the good old days! what’s something normal that you cherish nowadays?! i've connected with so many of you on here who love living in nyc and most aren't native new yorkers. everyone has their own story of what brought them here and why. i realized that although i've chatted to lots of you, i don't know the details of your story. i could just dm you but i thought it would be more fun to all share in the comments like a big group chat. i'll kick it off with my story please feel free to join in i first moved to nyc in 2013 for a one year internshipexchange program. it was probably the best year of my life. i had countless bucketlist experiences both here and throughout the uscaribbean, gained really valuable international work experience which set up my career, made lifelong friends and met my husband we actually met on the plane on the way over when we were both randomly upgraded to business class, but more on that serendipitous story later!. i was on a j1 visa, studying part time and working full time. the deal with that visa is that you are supposed to go back home after the year since it's specifically meant to be for a short term exchange. so faced with the prospect of not being able to stay in nyc and not being ready to go back to my small city in the north-east of scotland, i ventured to london and the now hubby and i spent 3.5 years trying to get back to new york. we eventually both transferred back here with our international companies in financial services on l1 visas the easiest way to get here if anyone else is trying to. until we were on the plane again i didn't really believe it was happening. but it turns out walt disney was right all our dreams can come true if we have the courage to pursue them and in our case they came true twice i would love to hear your story of what made you want to move to new york, how you got here logistically, and what you love about living here it must be so exhausting and hard work being a 1year old i mean miela’s face says it all emilia romper willow bloomer @sunnyandbeau @the.mama.crew basic celebratory pic since the weather was nice today!!!! so ready for the weekend i have several posts in my drafts,i just don’t have time to sit down and write a caption review and somedays i am just tired and want to nap. i’ve noticed these kinds of posts don’t get as much interaction as reviews do,which make sense but these kinds of pictures are fun to take. i also want to get better at styling a flatlay that looks effortless and cute,i’m sure some know what i mean by that anyway,hope you’re having a good week!

why is this important? because your brand deserves professional, top-notch visuals to go along with the stellar service you provide! new eye cream alert! @velyvelyglobal black truffle eye cream 1oz30 ml for $34 usd main benefits: anti-aging brightening nourishing key ingredient: black truffle which is rich in amino acids, meaning it’ll help with reducing wrinkles and hydrate the skin. packaging: it comes in an airless pump which is great for slowing down the oxidation process, keeping the product fresh and effective for longer. it’s also nice to not have to scoop from a jar, makes applying eye cream much faster for rushed mornings. my experience: i enjoyed using this eye cream for the texture as it was much easier to spread than the @heimishcosmetic marine care eye cream. it felt soothing spreading it across my eye area, something the heimish one lacked if i were to use it without the rounded metal spatula included. as for its anti-aging and brightening claims, i’ll have to continue to use it before sharing my final thoughts because i haven’t seen any changes with my dark circles just yet. tldr; inspired by @skin.ken soothing hydrating good fragrance which can be a con for many pr, gifted in exchange for my honest opinion i’ve never even touched a tennis racket before lol @garageclothing not only do my shoes match my bag, but my actions match my words probably distracted by a shiny object. wearing my coach snowboots i got for just $11 at a thrift store a few years back. rattan everything who doesn’t love a good handmade rattan bangle?? i do for real though, if it’s rattan, there’s a 90 chance i’m buying it any who, shop this customizable keychain bangle on our site week: day 4 this outfit was selected by my wildly imaginative niece, meghan. she loves to draw and write stories and songs. she wanted to create a dress for me so i included a sketch with beautiful shimmery fabric and threads. however... since we couldn’t magic it into existence, she settled on a dress covered in things i love. i chose dachshunds!

day 55 of getting stronger every day...225 x 5 squats [review] happy friday tried my hands on animation swipe left for the still shot of the products. say hello to snp prep peptaronic line @snpofficial.sg the product line promise: hydrate and restore skin vitality. star ingredients of the product line: hyaluronic acids and peptides. hence, peptaronic. how's my experience? peptaronic toner: this toner has a thick consistency, kind of gel-like. it is easily absorbed by the skin, which i like. it gives a refreshing feeling after. the herbplant scent is a bit much for my liking, however, it goes away shortly after applying it. peptaronic serum: the serum's consistency is thicker see previous texture tuesday. it is also absorbed by the skin right away. i don't find it sticky at all. the scent is the same as the toner, but it doesn't linger. peptaronic cream: i like the consistency of this moisturizer as it is creamy but not sticky. i wake up with supple skin whenever i use this. peptaronic tone up cream: contains pink kaolin this one is a pleasant surprise. i did not expect to ever like tone up creams until i tried this. for reference, i tried innisfree's tone up cream before, and it didn't work out e.g. white castpilling. my skin looked brighter and i see myself using this for a no make-up look. i just use a squirt from the tube and it goes a long way. peptaronic ampoule mask: i enjoy the brand's masks. this one contains marine seaweed and spirulina extracts. the mask is generous in size. it left my skin feeling hydrated. overall, i enjoyed using the products. i was initially scared of the scent, but as i have mentioned, it goes away shortly after application. product size is very generous, so a bottle of the serum and toner will last a long time prgifted opinions are my own save and share for support spring may be in 23 days, but the new springsummer catalouge by @thirtyone goes live on march 1st and i am so excited!⁣⁣ i’ve described it as the feeling you get when you open your windows and a fresh spring breeze floats in. if you want that spring feeling early let me know and i’ll get a catalogue to you.⁣ also special shout out to @88.pri for helping me create the grl power print so i could have it put on one of @thirtyone statement canvas pillows swipe to check it out! my office is coming along nicely and it is the perfect addition! feeling bummed as this is my last review on isntree products. dedicated the whole month to fully enjoy these in my routine. [pr] @isntree green tea fresh toner is a daily toner that relieves skin stress and adjusts oil and water balance. in site it says that they made an effort to keep the nutrients of green tea which is why it has a brown color. as green tea may differ every year, color of product may change. 𝐓𝐋𝐃𝐑; watery, light brown no alcohol, fragrance, and essential oil smells like legit tea effectively reduces sebum, but can be drying if used twice a day 𝐍𝐨𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐫𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬: 80 green tea extract from jeju, centella asiatica extract, salix alba willow bark extract, blueberry fruit extract, hydrolized ha, allantoin, beta-glucan anti-sebum phd longleaf pine leaf extract, david elm root extract, evening primrose extract, arowroot extract i love how complete their infographic is! the group of ingredients they curated to prevent excess sebum is new to me. 𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞: this toner has a watery texture and its natural scent is really relaxing. i incorporated this when coincidentally i had irritation on right cheek. it looks like there's an underground pimple that made that area look bruised. after 3 days, that part appeared less irritated. see my post on isntree mugwort ampoule for actual photos. this toner is great for oily skin, however i observed that applying it twice a day really dries out my face. the hydration it gives isn't significant. so, you might want to add a hydrating product afterwards. overall, this toner matched its claims with my experience. it effectively soothes and balances oil and sinks in beautifully on the skin. i'd love to keep this in my routine as i'm someone who can really use its help for oil control. texture 5, packaging 5, scent 5, performance 4, price 4 rating: 4.65 $19.50 200ml pao 6m i just finished my daily task this morning play with bacon. see last photo of how tired that chonk was happy friday, beautiful people! gracefully different be different, stand out. laugh loud, laugh till you cry even. be bold, speak up. your voice always matters. all you have is all you need to be successful. always remember the person who talks bad on you probably wipes their ass back to front. who really is hurting? drink water. wear sunscreen. ask god for the guidance to love yourself and also love others as he loves you. isss thursdayyyy organic, cruelty free, eco-friendly, ethically sourced making the world a better place one skin care product at time @lookorganics friendly reminder that you are important special loved even when your mind tells you you’re not attention m198 is now lash: “bloom” 25mm fluffy comfortable fast shipping link in bio only at www.ivyminks.com @target has been killing it with the cute purses lately! here are just a few that caught my eye recently. link to shop is in my bio. http:liketk.it39da4 http:liketk.it39dah @liketoknow.it throwback to this stunning woman @brookeparker.model photographer: @evertakaej ᴛᴏ ʙᴏᴏᴋ ᴏɴʟɪɴᴇ↓ ᴡᴡᴡ.ᴍᴀᴋᴇᴜᴘʙʏʜᴀʏʟᴇʏ.ᴄᴏᴍ.ᴀᴜ she believed she could, so she did... this really rings true to me, a print i have waiting to go up on the wall once i have some frames. all our prints include free pp, they are designed and printed by us, so totally unique to @jdthomashome we print on top quality 250gsm card and all prints are packed in recyclable cello bags to keep them water tight and into cardboard backed envelopes for postage mummies little helper. we are stalking the post office for some exciting deliveries. the upcoming end of summer always makes me a little sad.. but the extra excuse to buy new clothes definitely helps!

this knocks me off every time. i usually apply this at the back of my ears and my neck. this lotion is rich in lavender and oatmeal. lavender obviously is an ingredient known to calm you down and treat anxiety. this lotion lets me nap my worries away. if only i can drench myself in this lotion forever, i would! slowing down a bit today hope everyone is surviving the week! passing wisdom on repost from @deathrattlelegion this thing isn’t about kicking over graves, saying fuck the police although it is fuck the police!!!, wearing a lot of black and pentagrams and being an edgelord. each of these tenets and their principles is designed to make you the best version of yourself as a human being as possible with free reign and choice over your life without being blinded by money, afterlife promises or unrealistic expectations used to control people through organized religion. it’s simple here, when you are wrong promptly admit it! tenet 6. @thesatanictemple same restaurant, two different steves. trying to eat health vs actually knowing what eating healthy is. obese and exhausted vs healthy with energy. stuck and frustrated vs thriving and joyful! brain fried with a scarcity mindset vs hyper-focused with an abundance mentality. trying to survive and keep up vs pouring out and helping others. i can’t imagine life if you stayed stuck. i love both steves in these photos, but what i love the most is how much my favorite person in the whole world has transformed. and how you continue to become the best version of yourself. when’s our next day-date together?! black bean soup was a staple growing up but was it the greatest for my constitution? it was something i'd look forward to when walking through the door and being met with the aroma of these happy beans. i could have black beans every day but, knowing now, they weren't that amazing for my body constitution. i was someone who struggled with constipation and, though beans are considered full of fibre, my personal make-up didn't thrive on them what's amazing and healthy for one person, isn't necessarily the healthiest for another! so, why eat black beans? well, not only do they help avoid the quick rise of blood sugar levels when you eat them but they're also high in zinc, magnesium, and yes, fibre!! along with sustaining energy through the maintenance of blood sugar levels, black bean's rich phytonutrient content helps to support the body through inflammation and the constant stress response we put it through but it's important to tune into how you feel during and after a black bean meal. only you can identify what sits well and what doesn't pictured: black bean soup with a slice of avocado, coconut yogurt, and plant-based cheese español en comentarios i'm actually pleasantly surprised as i honestly didn't expect much, their foundation was a huge fail on me, probably one of the worst foundation that i've tried⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ this concealer works well for me, i really like the coverage it provides around my dark circles helps to hide my imperfections, it doesn’t emphasize the dryness under my eyes and this is perfect especially at my age, didn't emphasize lines.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ can be applied with fingers or a brush or sponge and still work perfectly⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ even if it 8ml, i think it will last a long time because you need to takes a very small quantity. the concealer has a thick but creamy consistency⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ really great value for money i'm actually pleasantly surprised as i honestly didn't expect much, their foundation was a huge fail on me, probably one of the worst foundation that i've tried⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ this concealer works well for me, i really like the coverage it provides around my dark circles helps to hide my imperfections, it doesn’t emphasize the dryness under my eyes and this is perfect especially at my age, didn't emphasize lines.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ can be applied with fingers or a brush or sponge and still work perfectly⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ even if it 8ml, i think it will last a long time because you need to takes a very small quantity. the concealer has a thick but creamy consistency⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ really great value for money strolling through the powder being 40 rocks!! and i say that because with that comes a level of clarity about who you are and what you offer the world. i’m so thankful to be able to share all things beauty with you all. man, it’s so freeing to be comfortable in your own skin. ever since i had my twin babies something changed in me and my confidence bloomed like never before. i appreciated my body in all its glory because a body that carries life or two in my case into this world is such an honor. and anyone who has ever done that is a rockstar!! i used to be the girl in high school that wouldn’t ever leave the house without makeup on. and i was confident then. but man oh man, there is nothing more beautiful than someone who can rock a natural face. and glow from the inside out. that’s where true joy is i have been wanting to start a beauty you tube channel for years. i bought all the equipment and the camera and never did it because i was scared. i was scared to put myself out there. but i’m not scared anymore. and i’m so grateful i found this platform to share all things beauty with you all and hopefully inspire you to not be scared and share your sparkle too!! if you’ve been hesitant to do what you’ve been wanting to do, whatever that is, i hope this inspires you to just go for it! let me know in the comments what you want to go for! what’s on your vision board for 2021? some february empties ok this month went by really fast because it felt like i just posted some of my january empties yesterday!!

a future repurchase from me as it is within my affordable budget range. this is worth a try, especially if your skin gets dry in colder months! @firstaidbeauty ultra repair cream in rosemary mint: pro tip tjmaxx usually has some fab products so check them out if you’re looking to try them on a budget. also follow my tiktok for more interesting tjmaxx skincare finds this was my first skincare purchase from tjmaxx last summer and first fab product. i didn’t mind the strong herbal mint scent because it was actually pretty soothing to smell. i didn’t try this on my face since i designated it as a hand cream and it helped keep my hands hydrated even after constant hand washing. i have another tub of the original fab cream that i’m opening soon the hype on this one is worth it! @kravebeauty matcha hemp hydrating cleanser: happy to report this is my hg cleanser until i find another one that gets the hg status in my book i love the soothing, calming gentle experience of using this and the key ingredients like matcha, hemp seeds, oats, and sodium pca make it even better for me and my skin. if you have dry skin and are looking for a gentle hydrating gel cleanser, mhhc may be the one for you!

and painting of the nursery and i have completely failed to show you the end result! i know it really shouldn’t matter, but i just really wanted to have everything in its place, to finally cement that we are ready for baby to arrive totally not by the way however, much to my husbands delight, i’ve decided that the featured mustard wall just isn’t right it clashes with our dark wood changing table and cot so there is just too much yellowwarmth and not enough contrast. i rushed buying the colour because i couldn’t breathe rushing around bq being pregnant and wearing the mask. i should have bought testers... but i was just so keen to get it all painted so the carpet could go down. however, i’ve decided that a light sage green, possibly @farrowandball’s teresa’s green or similar will work that much better. that way it’ll lift the colour of the room and i can incorporate some mustard furnishings and accompanying prints, which i’ll most likely get after baby arrives. i think that’s what’s made it tricky too not knowing whether we’re having a boy or a girl. it makes decorating the room that much harder so think it’s best we hold off injecting too much personality before we meet the little one. please tell me i’m not the only one who’s had paint regret...??? and i know i’m completely daft considering repainting a wall in my state but better now then before baby arrives right??? hello beauties, i am wishing you a fantastic friday as i daydream of paris diptyque edp eau capitale, a fragrance which combines an intoxicating blend of fruity, floral and spicy notes for a long lasting scent. fragrant top notes of bergamot and bright pink berries provide a lift to the middle notes of rich chypre rose. at the base, patchouli combines with the additional notes of ylang ylang, georgywood, cinnamon, akigalawood and ambrofix to help create a fragrance that is designed to conjure up the essence of paris. f r i y a y it’s friday and i’ve got a nice one ahead! zoom brunch with my girl @misskeveryday, catch up with my friend laura, some filming and youtube watching, a film to watch and a homemade lasagne for tea! as weeks off go, it’s been a good one! happy friday wearing: @commesdesgarconsplay makeup: @diorbeautylovers levensgenieters follow @midnightbus so my second valentine’s post is a little late, life got in the way! after our carnivoreveggie breakfast, i surprised my partner with an afternoon tea, couldn’t find a delivery option so decided to make my own, well i should say assemble my own as i purchased the slate cake stand from an online retailer and purchased the cakes from @gailsbakery that morning, i did make the cream cheese and cucumber sandwiches on gluten free bread as my partner me stomach prefers it for dinner we had home made pasta aubergine and mozzarella sauce, late in the day i decided to add meatballs to mine, although i had no pork or mince to hand so i split some sauces and ground some beef added so chorizo not sure where that idea came from i’m pretty sure it was the bubbles making my decisions by then custom ears how fun are these custom ears i made recently! i’m tempted to do each of the hp houses, what do you think? which house are you?? happy friday| just when it looked like spring was on it’s way we’ve woken up to a frost this morning! i don’t know about you but i’m over the cold weather now! i hope you all have a lovely weekend whether it be a warm or cold one happy friday| just when it looked like spring was on it’s way we’ve woken up to a frost this morning! i don’t know about you but i’m over the cold weather now! i hope you all have a lovely weekend whether it be a warm or cold one i usually love wearing colour...but some days just call for black, it’s so classic, timeless and striking often it’s a tricky colour to wear next to your face as can be very draining or ageing depending on the colour season that you sit in. accessories like jewellery, scarves and make up can all help to counteract these effects. it’s a fabulous and dramatic colour that definitely has a time and place in my wardrobe as christian dior said “you can wear black at any time. you can wear it for any age. you may wear it for almost any occasion.” a little fact about me i’m actually born on a leap year 29 feb although still confused what day i’m supposed to celebrate the children say i have two bdays but since i finished uni which feels like a lifetime ago...i thought this felt a bit much...which day would you celebrate?

got me thinking ‘bout better days. we each need to find our own inspiration. sometimes it’s not easy. let’s talk about rest days last sunday i really hurt my back and my knees have been pretty sore too. i knew i needed to take a break from working out we feel so guilty for taking some time out but we really shouldn’t. we work so hard out body’s need to rest and recover. it’s actually so important for us and for us to progress. for the last 8 weeks i’ve been working out 6 days a week and before that 3-5 days for a good year. i honestly cannot remember the last time i took a week off. i can safely say i feel like a new woman and am so excited to start again on sunday! i know that i now will be able to give 100 to my workouts instead of 50. listen to your body girls. take some time for you and don’t feel guilty. i promise it won’t stop or ruin your progress. 𝕀 𝕔𝕒𝕟, 𝕒𝕟𝕕 𝕀 𝕨𝕚𝕝𝕝 good morning! hope you are all well, happy friday! sharing this little tray styling this morning, i love faffing about with different accessories to make a space feel different. i hope you all have a lovely weekend whatever you are up to.. @ikeauk @hmhome i post that much on my story i always forget about here we’ve been moved into our home now a few weeks and the one room we’ve concentrated most of our efforts on is the kitchen area. we’re not fully done yet but over the last few days we’ve upcycled our builders plank table old chest of drawers i know everyone’s probably sick of me saying it but this time of our lives is honestly the most special, it’s a time that we got to share with our children and they will always remember, it’s a time of happiness and excitement that at one point we never thought possible. isn’t that what’s great about life; you never know what’s round the corner. a year ago this would have felt like an impossibility. it’s honestly like winning the lottery and i am grateful every minute of everyday and i hope this is how i will always feel as i never want to become complacent to the fact that sometimes you might wait a little longer than everyone else but you’ll always get there in the end ‘the ache for home lives in all of us, the safe place we can go as we are and not be questioned’ i can’t wait for dan to finish nights on monday morning!

cheeky snap whilst walking the pooch coat: @marksandspencer trousers: @primark tshirt: @urbanoutfitters hey sinkie we have loads of black accessories in our kitchen which we think work really well with the light wood and white walls. we also chose this black sink which complements everything else in the kitchen. it’s a tectonite sink which we’re told is a really heavy duty material but is really light and very durable it’s deffo one of the features we get a lot of compliments on but ngl it does show up a lot of mess if you don’t wipe it down often hence my pic of it looking super spic n span!

seriously thinking i want to panel this room now but promised my littlest beauty i'd do her room next so i'll have to wait! have a great friday got ‘dressed up’ yesterday to take elodie for her immunisations. luckily i did as it was the same day the health visitor did her video consultation which i’d totally forgotten about so i would’ve been in my pj‘s otherwise! although i have to say, a video consultation is pretty pointless in my opinion. as we all know on here anyone can project an image for 5 minutes that could not exactly be true! luckily i’m semi knowledgeable mum of 4 but i feel so bad for first-time mums in this pandemic. obviously elodie was premature and in neonatal intensive care and i’ve had less contact with health visitors and midwives with her then i did with any of the boys who were all healthy full term babies joggers @hm top @bershka trainers @balenciaga denim shacket @hm necklace @mynamenecklaceuk bought these trousers in in remember family holidays? if i give you morgi the corgi will you give me a banana? health is not just a physical entity. it is so multifaceted. health should not only cover going to the gym, getting a pt and promoting healthy eating. health also encompasses your wellbeing, your soul, spirituality, your emotions. your emotions affect your physical body, for example stress releases hormones such as cortisol in the body which puts us in a constant fight or flight situation and emotions such as happiness, touch and love can release hormones such as oxytocin and serotonin which naturally make us feel good. in the health field when we say we include soul and spiritual practice as part of health it usually involves us giving patients a form to identify which religion they align with so we can acknowledge that. thats it? we fail to look into the actual links between the famous phrase mind, body and soul our spirits and soul run our physical body and should have just as much attention as the physical body. our souls carry around things like trauma which impact on the physical body and our mentality. its a lot deeper than people think. health is holistic. follow @nurseangiejay follow @nurseangiejay comment, like, share happy friday team! how are you doing? the sun is shining here, looking forward to a nice glass of something later! this little beauty was a bespoke order from one friend to another. i was asked to combine crystals that would offer calm and balance, relieving any worry or stress. this gorgeous combination is made up of amethyst, blue lace agate, opalite and clear quartz. what do you think? remember you can always message for advice and custom designs! chloe morning, happy friday!.... i have been thinking of ways to like my sofa more, don’t get me wrong if it’s about comfort i would give it 11 out of 10 but i just don’t like the colour! mr b won’t let me change it as we paid a lot of money for it and it’s only a few years old. so i ordered lots of new cushions and a throw and have put them on there to hide it, it did make me laugh as george went and laid in the middle to hide the rest of it so job done! well for now anyway. we finished the queens gambit last night, omg it’s brilliant! if you haven’t seen it i highly recommend it. does anyone know of any other good series or box sets to watch? have a lovely day feeling the spring vibes today but so not ready to put these boots away yet!

thinking back to those days... scroll down for english wauw, echt gaaf! in oktober stond ik nog op dit plein deze kathedraal te bewonderen. vond vond ik 'm toch prachtig! daar zo trots op de top van de trappen. ik vond het jammer dat de kathedraal in de steigers stond, maar een afbeelding gaf weer hoe de kathedraal er uit moet zien. ook goed, want ik was eindelijk in amalfi! een lang gekoesterde droom om de amalfikust te bezoeken was werkelijkheid geworden. gisteren deelde felicia van @salernotravel op haar stories dat de kathedraal eindelijk zonder steigers is! des te meer reden om ooit weer terug te gaan naar deze magische plek. wow, really cool! in october i was still admiring this cathedral on this square. i thought it was so beautiful! so proud it stood there om the top of the steps. i was sorry that the cathedral was under construction, but an image showed what the cathedral should look like. good for me as well, because i was finally in amalfi! a long cherished dream of visiting the amalfi coast had become a reality. yesterday felicia from @salernotravel shared on her stories that the cathedral is finally without scaffolding! all the more reason to ever return to this magical place. tgif! this week has felt so long but it’s beautifully sunny already which always makes the day better right? freshly made beds mean one thing. the smallest one of the family has honed in to the fact it’s tidy which means he must get on it and slither himself in the middle of all the pillows because in his own words “it’s comfy mummy” some days i really don’t know why i bother but i just can’t start the day until the bed is made finally friday! we made it to the weekend people! it's sunny outside, i finish work earlier today, i'm feeling much more positive than at the beginning of the week, the man is already ordering some books to read next month and i've found another tv serie to fall in love with have you guys watched outlander? only 3 episodes in and i'm obsessed already ps. talking about obsessions: my new pink coat. happy fry-day!

we can all do our but to reach that summer freedom. so please, stay safe this winter i realised how beautiful the snow really is... and though i’m always cold, i now see it not only as something that makes me put on layers and layers of clothes, but also as a wonderful white creation of nature [product review] benton let's carrot oil toner an oil toner that contains carotene and carrot ingredients that provide rich nutrition to the skin, giving a firm, nourishing and moisturizing effect to the skin. volume 150 ml thoughts it's a bi-phase toner so you have to shake it before spraying it onto your face. i use this after cleansing and as the last step of my routine to see how it performs. the mist is fine which i really like. it has a very subtle refreshing scent and it instantly hydrates my skin and leaves a healthy glow. it doesn't feel sticky or tacky at all. after applying the rest of my skincare, i sprayed it again and it doesn't make me oily throughout the day. i noticed that may skin feels so smooth and moisturized all day. you can also use this as a toner mask if you have dryflaky patches on your face. overall, i enjoyed using this toner. it works well even though i have oily skin. i highly recommend this one especially to those who have dry and dull skin. benton let's carrot moisture cream it provides lively skin condition and glossy moisturizing by preventing moisture evaporation with various botanical oils and caring oil-water balance. volume 50 grams thoughts this cream is surprisingly lightweight. it applied thinly and smoothly onto the skin. a little goes a long way with this cream so i make sure to apply the right amount of product. it absorbs well and i like the smooth and hydrated finish it gives. it doesn't make my face look greasy or oily. so it's perfect as a daytime moisturizer. my only con of this cream is the scent.. it's just a bit strong. overall, this is still a good cream. my skin loves it. i love how lightweight and hydrating this is! both products contain eo so just a heads up for those who have sensitive skin pr for review purposes success confidence...it’s friday how was your week? what happened?… as you reflect did anything take place that may have knocked your self-confidence slightly? so if everything didn’t quite go to plan that’s okay, it will make you more resilient and you have learnt what you need to do next time. the link between success and confidence goes hand-in-hand. when you believe in yourself it allows you to rise up and see your true potential. everyone admires a self-confident person. the more confident you are, the more people you will attract in life, the more successful you will become. people are attracted to confident people. self-confident people are at ease with themselves and their work. they invite trust and inspire confidence in others. make a decision not to be obsessed over little things. focus on what you can control and what you can do. when you are yourself, playful, loving, warm and generous. people love to be around you. we are aiming to be comfortable in our own skin, in each situation. people often lack confidence because their expectations in life are not met. appreciate the small things in life and what you have around you. the quality of your life is going to exceed your expectations, and you will begin to attract the people and the things that you want. if you particularly enjoyed this weeks series on confidence, let me know. perhaps there is another series topic i can look for further resources on confidence please dm me. thenicoleannabelle@gmail.com happy friday!!

are you pushing the people you love and care about away in order to keep it quiet? are you looking at yourself everyday and thinking you look ‘fat’ or ‘ugly’? do you feel angry or upset if you miss a workout? if the answer is yes, then please know, things can get better. i spent way too many years being a victim to that voice. listening to everything it would tell me. i convinced myself and my family that i was working out for enjoyment. that i was eating for ‘health’. little did they know, it was just a way of restricting. eventually they saw through it, i got help, things were really looking up. no, they weren’t easy but they were getting better. the voice was getting quieter. exams. gcse’s came around. i couldn’t cope with the stress. the voice became louder again. running everyday, doing workouts in secret, eating barely enough to function, let alone get good grades. things got progressively worse. some how i managed to do my exams and get semi- ok grades. i made it to prom, but didn’t enjoy it because the whole time i was worried about what i wouldn’t eat in order to look good in my dress. i got drunk just so i could block out the voice. hospital. inpatient for 4 months because i let that voice get worse. i didn’t fight. it was the worst experience of my life, something which i wouldn’t ever wish on anyone. it didn’t help me, yes it made me realise how much i wouldn’t want to go back and yes i gained weight. but mentally it made that voice louder every day. i was discharged. things did get better. the voice began to get quieter. i got discharged from all ed services. i did lose weight again but that wasn’t intentional and now i’m properly on my journey to gaining it back. i am choosing to gain weight. i worked everyday to fight against that voice, until one day, it was gone. don’t get me wrong, i still have bad body image days and yes sometimes i feel uncomfortable but the difference now? i listen to those thoughts and ignore them. my point? no one’s journey is ever linear nor is it quick, mine has been far from that. cic toadstools these are now available to order, available in any colour. dm to order 2 years ago today. throwback to year 13, kinda miss school, do you? it’s crazy to see how far i’ve come. you guys are probably sick and tired of hearing it now but this is what i made my account for; to stay accountable and to track my progress, and that includes many, many throwbacks. if you know me from school days, you know that i’d love to wear my skirts and dresses.. but!!! i’d cover up my stomach all the time. i’d hide it when i’m walking, sitting, standing. even on the hottest of days, i’d be wearing a cardigan to cover up. i was so insecure of the fat i had stored there and when i’d take pictures like this, i’d suck in my belly like there’s no tomorrow, to feel good about myself. come on, we’ve all done it? we still do! i didn’t have my life together at this point in life if i’m being honest. stressed with coursework, exams and relationships, lmao look at the poor poster in the background, literally hanging for it’s dear life if i had posted this picture without the caption, i’m sure some of the comments would have been “girl your waist!!”, or even “damn your figure!!”, and not to toot my own horn, i do look kinda good here but let me remind you. i am posing, sucking in, and this was taken on an empty stomach and most importantly, i was struggling with body confidence and mental health. in fact, it was around this point where it started to go downhill and i didn’t even realise. appreciate your body, take care of it and love it!! self care is the best care and there’s no doubt in that happy friday everyone!! i am so glad it’s friday and the weekend is about to start, seeing as the sun has been shining i’ve tried to get out for an early morning walk before work and it’s so nice to be able to spring vibes are the best!! last few remaining ‘cupid’s bow’ sets in all sizes 𝐽𝑈𝑆𝑇 £18! last few remaining ‘cupid’s bow’ sets in all sizes 𝐽𝑈𝑆𝑇 £18! friday stripes work attire what a glorious friday hoping the sun is here to stay! happy friday everyone new release claxon it’s a new era for our favourite indie-hero, maisie peters @maisiehpeters today, as she released her new single and accompanying video for john hughes movie! we’re loving the track here at tfl hq, and can’t wait to see what the future holds for this wonderful angel give the track a listen and let us know your thoughts my gals are looking sharp this morning happy friday, it’s really feeling like spring is on the way today! it’s pay day which means time to spend my money on plants and presents🪴 combine that with mother’s day coming up very shortly cough sunday 14th march cough, i’m sure lots of you will be spending your hard earned coin over this weekend. think of me as your little genie, ready to save you some of your cash the deals on my story are only available until 10pm on sunday the 28th february, and whilst stocks last, so i’d recommend you be speedy as some of these limtied edition bottles are going quick! drop a comment or send me a message to order, and happy friday everyone xx introducing my latest prints.. ‘giraffepalm plains' swipe for details. this print is available with or without the giraffe. they style well with any colour scheme with their natural palette and textures. a big thank you for everyone who continues to support me bye bye baby... his last day in his baby class at nursery...feels like far bigger a step for me! than it should do we have an induction hour in his new class on monday, and one of his 'teachers' will move up with him for 2 weeks. i have no concerns whatsoever about him settling in somewhere new...it's more me that's going to need to adjust it's finally friday and the sun is out! i've the music on all through the house and i'm about to make some breakfast! just a simple shot of our hallway curtains..a favourite of mine from the @harlequinfw mirador collection! i got a couple raised eyebrows when i described our curtains as having zebras on them.. but i love how subtle and different they are! hope everyone has a lovely weekend x knowing your skintype is the first and most important step of building a good skincare routine! here's a guide on how to identify your skintype! what is your skintype?

do you have a favourite one? product was won in a giveaway. t.g.i.f who's got that friday feeling going on?? the sun is shining, spring is on it's way and it's looking to be bright all weekend! longs walks, hot coffee and a couple of movies are definitely on the menu what's your weekend plans looking like?

friday run 18:44 a new pb! must have been the gym wear the best bit, i didn’t stop! ran the entire 3km without walking! very proud of me! happy friday! i’ve been spoiled with macarons in the past week and it’s been a joy! @delicatemacaron has always been an avid baker and originally started making cakes but wanted to challenge herself more, leading her take on the notoriously difficult macaron. what started as a hobby soon turned into a real passion and subsequently a small business, the name coming from her outlook on life as well as the precision required to make macarons. for her, satisfaction stems not only from the different processes involved with the making but also the endless opportunities for creativity, as shown by the many colours and flavours she experiments with. the flavours in this box are: lemon biscoff candyfloss strawberry parma violet brownie batter toffee popcorn cinnamon apple pie salted caramel nutella white chocolate raspberry wow, what i selection i got to indulge in! i didn’t really know where to start with these as they all looked so intriguing, but the great thing about macarons for me is that they’re not heavy so it’s easy to sample lots at once necessary for review purposes of course. in general i tend to prefer the more natural flavours, so although i did scoff these down pretty quick, the lemon was the outright winner for me; the tart homemade curd surprise in the middle was a fantastic fresh burst and flavour balancer. photographed here is her mixed box which comes with set flavours she has chosen, but @delicatemacaron also offers a deluxe service which allows you to choose your own design, flavours and colours! with so much room for creativity, this is definitely going to be one of your more fun edible purchases. throwback fit dress @prettylittlething sunglasses @prettylittlething bag @kurtgeiger boots @drmartensofficial it’s a work from bed kinda day new gym top alert there is nothing like new gym wear to get you going in the morning! shake your tits, it’s friday! i can’t seem to find the proper name for this piece. some sources call it peasant girl” while others call it street musician.” does anyone know this painting's name?

i usually listen in the car and find it easier to jump in and out of nonfiction books. it also feels almost like a story time to me, and almost never reads how it would in my head. but maybe i’m listening to the wrong ones? comment below and let me know your audiobook preferences!

i hope you’re all doing great! i just wanted to share that, since february 2 of this year, i was officially welcomed by @wishtrendstory as one of their newest @wishtrend affiliates! they were kind enough to recommend and send me this lha blemish ampoule from @rovectinglobal as my first collab knowing that i have oily and acneblemish prone skin! rovectin products are known for being and what is it? it’s an everyday ampoule from rovectin’s clean line that hydrates and enhances skin with only the essentials: lha caproloyl salicylic acid that effectively works on unclogging pores and helps brighten dark spots left by blemishes; and 85 neroli flower water extract, that helps soothe and calm the skin with anti-inflammatory properties. the box it comes in is actually very uniquely designed as it includes stickers on the inside that you can use to decorate your bottle! all of which are reusable, and made using plant-based ink and biodegradable materials as well as recycled paper. as much as i wanted to play with the stickers, i really want to keep the box in its original form. i will be posting a full review on this as soon as i get a better chance at using it. right now, my skin is doing fine and i have no active breakouts nor any spots to treat. looking at the ingredients and the claims, this already sounds like a very promising product. again, to @wishtrendstory, you have my deepest thanks!

valid until feb. 28, 2021. have a wonderful day! when shopping at @monki for my latest outfit i picked up this lovely purple beret! as you may have noticed i love berets! since starting this account i’ve explored styles that i never would of worn before, for example hats are an item that i rarely wore but i have now grown to love them! i often felt put off by hats because i wasn’t sure what style of hat to wear or how to wear it. i now believe that hats have the ability to automatically make an outfit stylish and look put-together! since cutting my hair the way i wear hats has changed, i now wear my hats further back on my head, at an angle and i allow some of my hair to peek out so that i don’t look as though i have no hair at all! berets have become my favourite hats because of how versatile they are, the circular shape of berets allows you to adjust the shape to suit your best side or tilt it backwards or forwards to best suit your face shape and facial features. i also recently picked up some bucket hats from @monki so we’ll see how i style them, hopefully they’ll suit me!

a smile shows complete and true happiness. the more you smile the happier you are. it leads to more positivity. the act of smiling is actually proven to decrease depression and push aside negativity. the fact is no matter what you see when you smile others will see it differently. a smile makes you look so much more friendly and confident. your smile can bring a smile to someone elses face. it's the first thing a person can notice about you. you may not feel like your smile is beautiful but to everyone else around you it is just because a smile can show pure happiness so appreciate and embrace your smile, it's one of the most important assets in your life going for the neutrals and a trench today. the sun is shining and i feel like it's going to be a good day. hope you all have a great friday trench @zara jeans @topshop @asos tee espadrilles @zara finally weekend again wie war eure woche?

if you have ever felt like you can’t move forward, like there is something holding you back and you can’t change it no matter what.... this book is absolutely brilliant and addresses exactly this! the bug in our brain- our malformed self-worth. couple of months ago i realised i had self sabotage tendencies when it came to success or reaching another level in my life and i had no idea what to do about it. i felt so stuck and my body was physically refusing to cooperate because the idea of a certain level of success in my life would feel like i am not able to handle it, maintain it or that i don’t even deserve it. this book is teaching me that there is a way. and that almost everyone is fighting with the same problem of a low self-worth and success limit. where do you feel stuck? what dream are you working towards but feel like you can’t reach it? happy friday! i’ll be sharing 3 truths and 1 lie. guess which one is the lie! thanks for the tag @larosadaflamenca 1. i have lived in canada, south korea, belgium and the netherlands 2. sky diving is on my bucket list 3. i teach at an international school 4. i am currently learning dutch it's friday! the only decision you need to make today is bottle or glass?

i’m hoping to do a sofa swap and a park trip! happy friday!!! this week flew by, it was a tough one because there was so much to do. but i got to say it was a productive to say the least, full of doctors appointments, packing the hospital bag, filming some videos, writing blog posts, laundry, organization and deep cleaning, i think i can say this weekend i will relax. and of course it will probably be in the leggings shown on this picture, the leopard print sold me but they are so buttery soft i can’t help it but reach for it. what are you plans for this weekend? ps thank you all so much for all the sweet messages on yesterday’s post means a lot. also i am finalizing a blog post on the best stores to get workwear at a decent price, some are interviewing or going back to the office so i thought it would be an useful post for ya’ll. when noah started teething, my huzzband and i looked at each other with shock. noah had just turned 3-months old, and he started teething and teething hard. of course, family members didn’t believe it and said that he was too young, but we knew all the signs, and others had to get on board.⁠ it was happening! the first real sign that our baby was no longer a little newborn and that he graduated to the infant start of his new life journey. teething can be a challenging time for babies and their parents. soreness and swelling may make some little ones fussier and more reluctant about eating.⁠ on the blog, i'm sharing how to make teething easy for new parents. click the link in my bio to read now. big girl bed of dreams, perfect for sleepovers, pillow fights and lie ins cant wait to go back to disney when it’s safe, looking through photos from tokyo [ad unpaidnot sponsored; products were purchased by myself, only brands tagging] a rant skip to comment on skincare details if you’re not interested. yesterday a moderator of a radio station in bavaria poked fun at bts for those who don’t know. they’re a korean boyband and made jokes about them being the same as coronavirus and how they’re “little aholes”. the moderator also clarified that he wasn’t xenophobic as he drives a korean car, what even?! i mean, it’s fine if you don’t like their music, there’s no need to liken them to the coronavirus. and i don’t know, but i doubt that he would’ve said the same thing if the members were white. i’m just outraged. with the rising hate against anyone who looks asian here and in the us, is this even an appropriate “joke” to make on public radio? isn’t it just further fueling anger against us? i feel this also shows how deeply entrenched casual racism is in our everyday lives. i’ve shared about my encounters with racists over the last year. just a few weeks ago, a stranger was looking at the masks at a supermarket while i was next to it and casually told me that this is made in china st. like how was i supposed to respond to that? did she mean me or the masks? i really don’t know what else to say to this except that please just don’t say anything if you have nothing good to say. to be frank, i’ve never been more aware of how asian i look. these days, i’ve even changed my shopping time to when it’s less busy to avoid people like this, just in case. anyway here’s my morning routine that gives me strength. disclaimer: i took this a few weeks ago when it was super cold. [cont’d in comments] calling all bookworms. i’m currently reading “forgiving what you can’t forget” by @lysaterkeurst. so good! here are 3 key takeaways i have gotten from it: “to verbalize forgiveness, we have to verbalize what we are forgiving.” “the things marking us from yesterday are still part of the making of us today.” “forgiveness is both a decision and a process. you make the decision to forgive the facts of what happened.” this book is full of many truth bombs. warning: it is not light reading. it is h e a v y. but if ever you there is an emotion you’ve suppressed or a hurt you’ve not dealt with: this is your time and place to heal. if you’re ready. tell me in a comment: what's one book i should add to my reading list? afternoon all! i’m so happy it’s friday! i’m even happier that our new art is up on the wall. it’s a birthday present from my mum sister, i’ve wanted it for ages and @pedrotoo hung it for me yesterday if it hadn’t been my birthday i might still be waiting for it to be hung thank you @hollylinch83. this is easily becoming my favorite getting out of the house outfit! since we've been at home most of the last year, i rarely find a reason to get out of my sweatpants in the mornings. when there is an occasion like picking up the groceries instead of having them delivered this is my easy go-to. really any sweater, skinny jeans, and a simple pair of flats. on another note, i still love my skinny jeans and my hair is never centered. plus, my most used emojis are the laughing so hard they're crying emojis. does this mean i'm old!? out on our daily walk.. isn't it so nice to have a few days without rain.. kids are killing each other today, anything to distract them!! back to school for 2 of them on monday! they are v excited... raspberry lemonade on ice please!! @looxibeauty salted caramel as inner lid shimmer @acebeaute nostalgia palette mattes for my wing, blush, and inner corner @glossier stretch concealer @lauramercier setting powder happy friday!! i'm in love with looxi's shimmer formula so much salted caramel is supposed to have a subtle green flip which i didn't capture very well. we have another sneak peak of a piece from our first collection “essential” coming tonight source: @pinterest how is it friday already!? happy weekend everyone! boho vibes this mirror is probably my favourite home decor piece right now and such a bargain beautiful day with the sun on our faces happy friyayyyyy feeling so happy today that the sun has popped out for a bit and i’ve had a lovely walk and lots of fresh air which has been lush just wanted to pop on here to say thank you so much for all the support lately, i really appreciate it i love seeing everyone’s fitness journeys, they’re all so unique and most people are working their socks off trying to better themselves whilst they have other challenges to deal with too and i think it’s so inspiring to see so be kind, be mindful and always aim to be the best version of yourself and don’t be too hard on yourself, you’re doing waaaaayyyy better than you think!. give yourself a break too and have a lovely weekend we made it friends! another weekend coming up i pulled a few of my favorite spring arrivals from @evereveofficial the other day. which one do you think is my favorite?? hint: it’s at the end. tgif! how is it the end of february already?! going shopping with my mini me today hope you all have a 𝓁𝑜𝓋𝑒𝓁𝓎 day!

who’s got that friday feeling?! rolling into the weekend wearing our beautiful delicate bow @papercrownshopuk 𝔛 𝔛𝔩𝔩𝔩 𝔐𝔐𝔛𝔙𝔩𝔩𝔩 today’s feature friday is dresden holden @dresdenholdenwellness dresden is a licensed acupuncturist and herbalist in santa barbara. dresden went to school in austin texas to study energetic bodywork, and graduate school for integrative and traditional chinese medicine. “health, natural health, the body, energy and environmental studies have been an interest of mine since i was a teen.” dresden’s acupuncture and herbal medicine practice is focused on women’s health, fertility and orthopedics sports medicine. “acupuncture is so amazing and can address any ailment or need. it brings balance to the body which can address disease, but it can also prevent illness by treating any imbalances before disease manifests. in addition to acupuncture, i also do herbal medicine, cupping and reiki.” for those seeking help with fertility, acupuncture has been proven effective in augmenting positive outcomes and to improve efficacy when paired with assisted reproductive therapies iuiivf. in terms of pain management, injury or post-surgery recovery acupuncture can address muscle imbalancesalignment, assist recovery, reduce scar tissue formation as well as reduce inflammation while increasing our pain-reducing feel-good neurotransmitters. “another product i offer is organic, nontoxic skincare and gua sha tools. i decided to clean-up my skincare routine and began using my herbal and natural oil knowledge to make my own products with simple and pure ingredients. i also incorporated acupuncture, herbal medicine and some dietary changes to treat my body from the inside.” to find out more about dresden and the services she provides, head to my blog to read the full post product: @pourlairscents hayloft candle $65 for 9 oz.⠀ why it’s a pick: i love the concept for this candle brand. aside from the usual fragrance notes, each scent is given a story, a purpose and a character. and these aren’t your everyday fragrance notes either. this scent, hayloft, has playful notes of hay, creek water and wet concrete. you don’t see those everyday. i love how the story behind a scent can set a mood. read this description from their site and you can practically smell it through the screen: “hayloft is designed to take you to a place where you feel your instincts. where natural smells of hay mingle with wet concrete and wood to ignite your insides and make you feel youthful and alive.” i appreciate how much the founder of the brand, jocelyn fortier, is thoughtful about the details, you can feel her passion shine through in the products. the throw on this one was pretty incredible too, the scent filled up a huge space. i found the burn time to be longer than advertised too, it seemed to burn forever. the prompt for day 26 of challenge hosted by @dressingdawn is a goal i have for this year. i have several in different facets of my life. 1. learn to better live with uncertainty. be okay with not being in control of everything. i am such a control freak and it gets in the way of me enjoying life sometimes and isn’t always great for the people around me either. 2. only add 21 items total to my wardrobe this year including loungewear, etc. as a part of that, continue to recognize when i’m using shoppingnew clothes as a quick fixcoping mechanism. 3. get promoted at work. kind of self explanatory, but that’s a biggie for me off this platform. happy friday! i look so tired but i guess that’s what happens when you don’t wear makeup this is a full-on outfit repeat from last year and i’m not mad about it. just keeping it real. details in the winter sun 𝐓𝐆𝐈𝐅!!!⁣ can you believe february is already coming to a close??

i'd love to know which ones you recommend it’s the last day of the lunar new year, so it’s my last chance to post something cny related wanted to post something earlier on but life got cray! hope everyone who celebrates cny had a great one despite such trying times not a review, but i recently purchased the @stratiaskin liquid gold finally?! as my krave gbr is nearly running out! so excited to try this highly raved about moisturiser after having it in my wishlist for so long have you tried liquid gold?

mineral sunscreens are products that i don’t really gravitate too. i’m not opposed them, but the don’t have the greatest reputation amongst people with darker skin. it’s giving casper. i’ve tried a few. many were misses, but i have came across some hits. i really like this @colorescience sunforgettable total protection face shield in the shade bronze. this looks really great on me imo and gives me an amazing glow. they do have lighter shade for lighter complexions as well. i do think that they should extend the shade range for those who may have darker skin than i do because this one will probably will leave a cast on some i also enjoy the @elevenbyvenus on-the-defense sunscreen by @venuswilliams. this sunscreen was pure white so i was scared lmao, but this mineral sunscreen really does go on without leaving a cast. i was perplexed when i tried it. it is thicc and feels heavy on top of moisturizer. to combat this i just skip moisturizer and use a light oil before application instead. neither of them are cheap, but if you absolutely have to have a mineral sunscreen and don’t mind the splurge then i would say try these are they any mineral sunscreens that you enjoy? happy friday! here's another look from the vault of it isn't perfect so i didn't know if i should post it before. my lids didnt want to cooperate and caused a ton of fading throughout the photos, but i also didnt prime so kinda on me. the highlighter also refused to show up on camera even if i were to adjust the brightness, but it was really beautiful and you'll just have to trust me i love playing with color and really wanted to get a whole psychedelic vibe. the shape was accidental but i kinda like it?

pink has been growing on me lately pink has been growing on me lately first week back, done. it’s felt like we’ve never been away. yet very full on and if i’m knackered then all the kids who have gone back are bound to be completely overwhelmed and done this weekend. so i think an easy few day is needed for children everywherenot that we have much options to go and do stuff small walks, cuddles and reconnect is what is in order afternoon, i have been in the garden all day cleaning the pond which was very much needed. the weather has been bloody lovely today going for a long walk now, to catch the last of it! has anyone else taken advance of the beautiful weather today?

würd gern bezahlte werbung für machen, email siehe profil! dm wär auch ok. i will try to be as objective as possible on this review. i also believe that what didn’t work for me, might work beautifully for you. if you look at the second picture, you will see the “beforeafter” photos. upper one was taken in october, lower one was taken this morning. as you can see, there is no beforeafter to talk about really. i don’t expect to get rid of acne completely, and there is no miracle product, however, i do expect a $88 serum to improve the overall appearance of my skin, maybe decrease the amount of painful zits that i’ve been getting every 2 weeks. there is one positive side to this experience: this serum contains lactic acid, which my skin has responded to very well, and i will be looking into lactic acid treatments as a part of my exfoliation routine. safe to say i am extremely disappointed. my skin looks the worst it has ever been, and i’m honestly at loss in terms of any future treatments, because i am not emotionally ready for another expensive disappointment. any recommendations for a retinol product that has worked for you would be appreciated. stay strong acne people, you’re pretty no matter what 𝟠 𝕞𝕠𝕟𝕥𝕙𝕤 𝕠𝕝𝕕 i'm just as shocked as you are zoë-anneliese! how are you 8 months old already barbell dumbell shoulders shoulder workout coming your way today to target those delts! i don’t usually train muscle groups by themselves but shoulders are my favvv so i love to isolate them once in a while. only 5 exercises but by the end, that superset had my shoulders cryin here’s the workout: upright row oh press 2 8 sa shoulder press 2×10 each arm superset 3x front raises to failure lateral raises to failure finisher 1 minute of up-and-down planks barbell dumbell shoulders shoulder workout coming your way today to target those delts! i don’t usually train muscle groups by themselves but shoulders are my favvv so i love to isolate them once in a while. only 5 exercises but by the end, that superset had my shoulders cryin here’s the workout: upright row oh press 2 8 sa shoulder press 2×10 each arm superset 3x front raises to failure lateral raises to failure finisher 1 minute of up-and-down planks phew we made it again happy friday! how will you be relaxing this weekend?

you can see how someone who is already afraid to get close to someone would feel nervous that they are choosing the wrong one. when looking for a long term match it really is as simple as finding your best friend, someone you can communicate and grow with, and someone who shares an attraction to you. link in bio for the pod! giveaway closedhappy friday i’m very happy to announce an exciting 𝔾𝕀𝕍𝔼𝔸𝕎𝔸𝕐 with @auratenewyork i’ve partnered with the most sustainable, beautiful, and women-owned jewelry brand to give a pair of the gorgeous 𝕀𝕟𝕗𝕚𝕟𝕚𝕥𝕪 𝔻𝕖𝕔𝕠 𝕋𝕣𝕚𝕡𝕝𝕖 𝔾𝕠𝕝𝕕 𝕙𝕠𝕠𝕡 earrings which are made with vermeil using 14k gold valued $150! to enter: 1. like this post and follow @auratenewyork @cklothes 2. tag your bestie more tags more entries 3. for an extra of 3 entries, share this post on your story make sure to tag me so i can see! giveaway ends thursday, march 4th 9pm est and the lucky winner will be announced on my story the following morning i will also message you on how to claim your prize if you can't wait understandable tbh, use my code cklothes20 to get 20 off your purchase now! happy friday! recently, i’ve been switching up my shower products and started using this coconut exfoliating bar from @creightonsbodybliss .i’ve been loving how soft my body feels after and the smell is divine! what’s one new thing you’ve tried recently?

i have hidden two clues in my edit the new friday night loungewear married at first sight hope you all have a great weekend today’s review is about my favorite ha product, the reformulated version 2020 of the premium gokyujun lotion from the japanese brand hada labo. i was already a big fan of the old version that i’ve used for many years so i was very excited to try the new version. 𝗙𝗼𝗿𝗺𝘂𝗹𝗮 this lotion compared to the previous contains 7 forms of ha old version 5 forms. yes 7 the new interesting ha form in this formula is the anti-inflammatory fermented ha. this product, as all hada labo lotions contains an exclusive form of ha the super hyaluronic acid that has 2x the moisture retention of ha. so super hydrating. and also it has ha of very different molecular weights that will really impact your skin on different levels, on surface and way deeper! it has also algae-derived sacran that will help retain moisture. 𝗧𝗲𝘅𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 the texture is kinda thick for a lotion lotion is also the other term for toneressence or whatever you want it’s more like an hydrating serum actually. not sticky. 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗜 𝘂𝘀𝗲 𝗶𝘁 i can use it both am and pm. am as an hydrating serum. at night i’ll use it right before my serum. not on a cotton pad. always on damp skin.

the end is finally in sight.. summer 2021 i’m so ready to see my family and friends properly again the skin concern of 2021? a compromised barrier function. a healthy skin barrier helps defend against environmental stressors while simultaneously protecting the skin's water balance. when this barrier becomes out of balance, your skin becomes sensitised, dry, itchy, and inflamed. repairing the skin barrier might sound daunting but a gentle skincare routine focused on reducing inflammation, boosting ceramides, hydration and repair helps to keep skin happy long-term. our favourite barrier repair elixir is the ceramide-rich byonik seal with provitamins a, b1, b2, b6 and biotin to help skin create a seal of freshness that protects it from internal and external damage. shop through the link in bio! empty 38: necessaire the hand cream we all know how covid and masks have affected our faces, but one area i think we don't talk about enough is the toll on our hands. i've started washing my hands more as a result of covid, and that's made my already-dry hands suffer even further. i've been trying to make sure that i apply hand cream after each wash to help minimize that dryness, and that's where this comes in. for context, i do have dry hands normally owing to some mild eczema, and this goes doubly so for the winter. this is described as a fast-absorbing hand cream intended to hydrate and soothe the skin. it contains humectant superstars such as glycerin and peptides, various moisturizing agents like shea butter and marula oil, and vitamins like niacinamide vitamin b3 and vitamin e. this formula is fragrance free which is particularly important when talking about compromised skin like the skin on my hands. i also want to shout out the fully recyclable packaging, which is rare for me to find in a hand cream. overall, i liked this. this lightweight cream was very quick to absorb, and a little bit went a very long way. i found that this hydrated my hands nicely and helped blunt the effects of constant hand washing on my hands. i found this cream to have a luxurious feeling which i appreciated, as most luxe-feeling hand creams don't work as well for me as this did. my only issue is that i don't feel that i got quite enough hydration from this my hands are much drier than most, and i feel that i personally need something more intense than this during this time of year. overall, this was nice and i'm glad i tried it. i think for most people this is a very nice hand cream that will work well, especially to be stored somewhere like a desk or purse where you don't want a hand cream to be thick-feeling for a long period of time. for me, however, i need something more intense because of the eczema on my hands, so i'm not likely to repurchase. 45, would not repurchase. product cost: $20.00, yearly running total $568.08 bubble the trouble on friday!! had a fun today playin wif deez bubble fingys. check out ma story to see me pop dem all!!! watch out mj, ders a new king of pop in town wot are you doin dis friday?! otto this time last year, i was settling into my first big freelance contract. i bought a few new clothes because i was going to be in the office pretty much every day. it goes without saying: that pretty much didn't happen. 2 weeks in to march, oregon went into lockdown. on danny's birthday, actually. the rest, as they say, is history. it's weird to think how much has changed in the last year. i've gotten more perspective. i've gotten more insight into my own life. i feel like i've grown in so many ways, but i've also found myself disappointed, and sad, and isolated, and upset more than i wish. as we approach the one year anniversary of lockdowns, i know a lot of us are feeling even more sad. we really thought it would be done by now, but unfortunately, that's not the case. give yourself space and kindness and room to feel that sadness. today we hear from tee, founder of @teestreatsuk. i'm tee, and i run @teestreatsuk, selling vegan friendly baked treats. i noticed that there was a gap in my local market not many places nearby were vegan friendly, and those that had a vegan menu had items that contained nuts. after a final push from friends and family, i set up tee's treats in august 2020. i've since expanded into postal bakes and now deliver across the uk. all of my bakes are vegan friendly and nut free, and a large range of my items can be made gluten andor soy free at request, meaning that there is something for everyone to enjoy! my advice to anyone wanting to start a small business is to not be afraid to fail at first every day is a learning experience! also, stay on top of your finances! coming at you with some serious 90s girl band vibes today how are we all? my mood is definitely lighter today which feels amazing i’ve been journaling and meditating every evening which has really helped and i’ve also accepted certain things i can’t control. today is check in day obvs, it’s friday and even though i haven’t been able to do my upper body sessions, i have made sure i ticked every other single box this week. so that’s legs, cardio, abs, steps, all the water and kept my nutrition straight. and i’m actually really happy with that. calories have been upped on rest days so i’m now eating the same cals every day of the week and i think that’s just the icing on the cake i needed today happy friday all if it hasn’t been your week either, brighter days are coming. just hold on it’s friday! just closed my laptop and i’m ready for the weekend! pictured here is a little gem that’s been stowed away in my make up bag for years. it’s never seen the light of day and i don’t even know if it’s expired or not but she’s a beauty and i felt she deserved her time to shine the dolce and gabbana classic cream lipstick in shade ‘venere’. adds a touch of luxury to my make up collection and will forever be too pretty to use! hope you all have a lovely friday evening! playful little hairstyle finding new hairstyles can be such a struggle with long hair but i’m hoping to step out of my hairstyle rut and try new hairstyles this year. i’m actually enjoying the process! wearing the stardust necklace from @andalways and the mon amour name necklace in gold from @mintandlily always look on the sunny side of life happy weekend lovelies theme 3: spring vibes! spring means pastels for me! so to my very patient photographer today hehe @eoghanc24 am i daphne bridgerton yet?

ours is pasta so when i saw these pasta bowls in the most beautiful sea teal colour i knew we had to have them i remember during our first lockdown being on the phone to my mam talking about how i knew i needed the place to be light and airy and colourful, then what did i do? decided to paint the kitchen black don't get me wrong, i do actually still like it but for a north facing kitchen that gets littleno natural sunlight, it's just not the right fit. and so with that, the kitchen is also on the cards for a little paint palette uplift the view was 1010. ladyfingers dipped in coffee and layered with cream and cocoa powder the easiest kind of unauthentic but still amazing tiramisu recipe you will ever come across! i have a video for this on my youtube channel if you want to check it out, the link is in my bio here’s the recipe: mix 2 tablespoons of instant coffee with 3 cups of hot water and let cool whip together 200 g of heavy cream and 200 g of mascarpone i think this is like a cup of each with a teaspoon of vanilla and 2 tablespoons of sugar also sidenote: i usually use half mascarpone and half cream cheese or all cream cheese every option is delicious just do as ur heart pleases until soft peaks form dip your ladyfingers into the coffee mixture place a layer of lady fingers then a layer of cream then repeat and chill in the fridge for at least 4 hours but preferably overnight dust with cocoa powder and serve :d smile it’s fri-yayyyyyy!!! what’s something you’re thankful for?i think a lot of people don’t show enough gratitude, and that’s something i have to remind myself too. let’s start together, write down at least five things every day for which you are grateful. i promise, this will change your view on a lot of things in life. so this picture was taken maybe a month ago, i just added today the texts. this is a reminder for me, for you, for everyone that pictures on instagram don't, or rarely show you what's behind the scenes. -that i tried to take a good picture of me at least 50 times. -that i thought that this clothes will look good together. -that i forgot to pack up my previously tried on clothes. -that i forgot to correctly set the timer. -that i have this lagging face so i just wanted to say to don't forget about the pictures which were not posted. you are all beautiful and awesome! never compare yourself to others! happy friday! also, sorry for having a third post today. sunshine on my mind cute vest and bag are from @styleondem.uk friday mood: it's the last weekend of the month and although it's cold outside, it's sunny so i'm going to try and run some errands today, before getting back to my computer for more work since it will be raining for the rest of the weekend. what are you doing today?

“so we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.” 2 corinthians 4:18 all of our experiences in life are determined by how we perceive reality. read that again. i’ll wait..... ...and again. this is something that is very easy to kick to the side, but something that is very important to be reminded of every.single.day. our entire experience on this earth really comes down to our mindset and how we perceive reality. if you think negatively all the time, you’re going to attract negative things. on the other hand, if you only think positive thoughts, positive things will come your way. you get what you put out, so you choose. every experience we have in this life is our choice when it comes down to perception; so shape your life how you want it because we only have so much time on this earth, why focus on the negative? i hope everyone has an amazinggg friday and takes this reminder with them, because i know it’s something that helps me day in day out. love you all. peace out my phone case really has seen better days🥲 stripes my everyday earrings that i love so much!

health, wellness, fitness, nutrition, in my opinion they all mean something different to everyone! i have been feeling a lot like you see the same thing over and over and over on instagram, and it reminds me of diet culture. there is no right way or one way for health and fitness. i think that is the beauty of it all! it can change with you and it should work for you! following what someone else is doing isnt going to make your fitness and health goals come true. it is a lot more work than that. you kinda have to go through a self-evaluation phase and really ask yourself what is important, why its important, and what your priorities are. then wake up everyday and continue to remind yourself that your golden just the way you are, but it’s ok to strive to be 1 better than yesterday then go freaking crush your goals! my first and only real tip around health and fitness is to make sure you are doing it for you and it works for you! happy friday babes! anyone else love joggers as much as i do? they can be dressed up or dressed down, and you really can’t beat the comfort obsessed with these joggers i just got from @elevenoaksboutique!

i won't lie i'm feeling a tinyyy bit anxious of actually writing on it because i don't want to make it messy but i'm also super hyped to start my journey- eeek! hopefully calligraphy will help me reduce the time i spend on social media hahaa swipe to see pics of the stunning box and of my personalised page which was sort of inspired by my current brain mothering sunday is a day that many dread, a day for a strained smile a day just to get through, or a day they just want to remember their lost loved ones. i made this interlocking butterfly and heart ornament in memory of my late dad, as i dread father's day each year, but i distract myself via my kiddies and hubby. if you would like to have a memorial item for your lost love one dm me here or via my etsy shop www.handmadebycatuk.etsy.com. id be more than happy to help xx cheers to the weekendwhich do you prefer? red, white or rosé i’m a big salad girl. i mean what’s not to love? salad doesn’t have to be boring mixed greens in a sad dressing-you can add whatever you want to it, make it filling, nourishing delicious. also-if you’re like me and enjoy having a large volume of food, big saladsbowls are it. i like large volumes cuz i can easily ear more slowly lol and satisfying to have a lot on your plate. in this pic: romaine lettuce baby brussels cherry tomatoes red onion crispy tofu walnuts for the dressing, i used garlic-dill mustard from @officialfarmboy, olive oil, lemon juice, balsamic chilli flakes. salad dressings you buy in store are usually full of extra sugars and unnecessary ingredients so if you don’t already, try making your dressing at home! that’s all. happy friday happy friday! a nice non-scale victory to kick start the weekend. i originally wanted to lose weight because my clothes had started to feel tight or didn’t fit at all and i felt really unhappy within my self. this dress and these photos are a massive indicator of the changes i’ve made. not only have i lost weight, i’ve gained so much more confidence that just wasn’t possible for me personally before. whilst the original goal was to fit back into my old clothes as you can see they’re now getting too big so this one will be saying hello to the bin bag! normally i’d put them to charity if they’re barely worn but i popped a button on this one trying to squeeze into it last summer. still have a little bit to go towards my new goal but i’ve made a lifestyle change that has resulted in a much happier and healthier me! i’m of the opinion that if you’re happy that should be all that matters good times and crazy friends make the best memories @reaganbush08 dad trousers for the winn friday review i decided to do a swatch guide on @maccosmetics lipsticks based on its finish, or you can say formulation. did you know there are 13 lipstick finishes produced by mac? i mean really? so to keep it simple let’s go with cream, matte and everything else in between. part 1: cream finish classic bullet tubes mac lipsticks satin finish satin finish has a slight semi-matte sheen and is less drying for the lips, these generally have a good opaque coverage. cosmic comic it’s a hair darker and more brown then a nude shade for my lips. rebel -it’s moderately cool-toned, dark berry color mac red -again a cool-toned, medium-dark red color amplified this formula gives a heavy opaque coverage that is similar in opacity to the matte ones, light sheen finish. great colour pay off brick-o-la this is a warm-toned, medium berry color lustre these are relatively sheer but easily buildable but i find after few swipes it looks patchy. it gives you a glossy finish more like pigmented glaze plumful -this again a very cool-toned, medium plum or as they say blossoming rose-plum spice it up this is a moderately warm-toned, more brown than berry color my least favorite from my own collection frost very metallic shimmer based color all i can say for this is, please swatch. this formula is very difficult to work with purple rite a frosted cool tone purple still regret buying this part 2 is coming next week friday and it is all about matte tip: best way to build your mac lipstick collection is to wait for the holiday mini sets. thank you @deepsdewangan and @djprisna for spoiling me with all these mac holiday gifts now i can open my own lipstick ta dukan it’s finally here!

available now via my website! remember you get 10 off your first order when you subscribe!! some new ish products that i’ve been loving and it includes some brands like @cocokind and @farmacybeauty that i have noticed to be slowly gravitating more towards daily. cocokind has definitely proven to be such a wonderful brand, there are definitely a few things i would still love to try out but haven’t. i know that when i purchase a product it will be made with ethically sourced ingredients that my skin will love. farmacy has also been amazing for me right now. honey halo is such a beautiful moisturizer and green clean is a nice cleansing balm that i use every night and has never disappointed me. @mytopicals faded serum is new to me but i have used it consistently since buying it and i do think it really helps to lighten dark spots and even out skin tone. i went through a period of time where i broke out a lot and then got obsessed with popping my pimples so i really do like this to help with acne scarring. @theinkeylist succinic acid spot treatment is a really cool spot treatment and works really well for whiteheads. it’s got a green tint to it so i do find myself having to rub it in a bit to blend in. these joggers @boohoo popping off british spring essential! the vera coat hits all the marks with its clean and minimalist approach to an everlasting classic. made in a water repellent poly-cotton blend, its slightly oversized cut with raglan sleeves and matching belt allows you to style it however you want. cinch the waist to style it the way ingrid bergman would have or wear it loose over a wide leg jean and a colorful shirt for a preppy look. i am absolutely in love with this beautiful popgrip from @popsocketsuk it’s so useful and i cant believe i didn’t have one before!!!

you’ve had a tough year doing so much of this job alone not that you need anyone’s opinion, but it’s ok to feel robbed of a life that includes raising your littles with their grandparents and their whole family. it’s ok to feel sad if you didn’t get to introduce your baby to all your favorite people after he or she was born. it’s ok to feel guilty that your baby’s first birthday wasn’t the family gathering you always dreamed it would be. you did your best this year with what you could. it’s also ok if you loved that you got to soak up all of the first year with your little one. maybe you feel glad that you didn’t have to share your baby with anyone else. right now, as i look at this picture, i feel so lucky that i got to share maggie’s birth with both my mama my mother in law. my parents and in-laws got to embrace her and welcome her into this world. but there were many days i wished i could have had her before everything started so we could have our normal life together. it’s normal to feel whatever it is you’re feeling, on whatever day. it doesn’t mean you are a bad mama or you aren’t so thankful for the life you have. but! if i know one thing, it’s that after last year, you have created yet another layer of strength for yourself that you probably never knew existed. and if you made it through that, you’re game for the next 100 lifetimes i'm just popping up in your feed to remind you that its friday, so don't forget to do something fun for yourself this weekend! products used: @eloisebeauty the queen palette @hudabeauty new nude palette @anastasiabeverlyhills riviera palette @tartecosmetics shape tape @morphebrushes 35m palette @inglotcosmetics duraline @wanderbeauty unlashed mascara @tartecosmetics gifted mascara @itembeauty brow chow in medium brown fc:1344 when lockdown is over, we can’t wait to see you all wearing waste to waist @eleanormaygreen wearing one of our best sellers exposed seam midi dress made entirely from recycled material tap to shop or order on www.wastetowaist.com soft selfie s-moments soft selfie s-moments no matter how often i tell you i love you, i will always love you more than that it’s friiiiiidaaaaay and the sun has been shining.. what more could we want?

dress up for no one but you or at least practice for june 21st pull up best dressed like @leahhartley in the pu 'mimi' leggings it’s been a while since i did an earring try on, so here’s the moon phase earrings mainly so you can see the actual size of them! happy friday everyone! not me, i’m still going strong with dry february...two days left! happy friday friends!! hey cutie photo dump. scroll to see the journey of my emotions this week. some food all over the place y’all be easy now. happy friday. if you need us we’ll be hibernating in our favourite room for the next few days ..what a week! have a lovely weekend beautifuls and remember try not punish yourself for doing nothing, you are not lazy, you are doing what gets you through this crazy time the sun shined, and i picked my baby up from school for the first time in a long time look at those blue skies i feel emosh ‘when you’re curious, you find lots of interesting things to do.’ colourpop make me blush set review february is coming to a close but i'm not quite ready to say goodbye to reds, pinks, and purples. and don't think these adorable heart shaped blushes from @colourpopcosmetics was a seasonal thing, i love these shades more than i can say. the pink shade, my type is my unexpected favorite from the trio. i finally understand the cool toned pink blush trend that i've seen kylie jenner rocking all the time. it's surprisingly flattering and youthful. the red shade, luv me, is the shade that i was most excited for because i've never seen a blush this color. it's going to compliment so many different skin tones, and on my fair skin, it makes me look like i have the most gorgeous winter flush. and lastly the neutral kiss n' tell shade is definitely not going to be for everyone. i think it's strictly going to work for very fair skintones because it's a much lighter shade than the compact makes it look. even if you have light skin it won't show up on you. nonetheless, i feel ike very fair skintones get forgotten a lot when it comes to shade selection, so i'm glad to have this blush, it is the perfect everyday shade for me that will go with basically any look. the one downside to this product is that these compacts are way too difficult to open, especially if you have long nails, but they're worth it to me. do you wanna pick these up? what do you think of the shades? let me know below, and as always, take care ⠀⠀w i n t e r v i b e s⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ black to blonde 🪄only took 3 visits wanting to change your black hair? but no hairdresser will go near you?

in iron age times winchester was a fortified settlement before becoming known as venta belgarum in roman times. in 827, egbert the first king of all england was crowned in winchester and in 1519 winchester was chosen as the capital of the kingdom of wessex. in the 11th century william the conqueror was crowned in both winchester and london making both the capital. in the 14th century, winchester lost its place as the 2nd most important city and started to change into the place we know and love today. egbert it’s a wear-your-pajamas-outside kind of day anybody else inexplicably exhausted this week?

life is hard for one of two reasons, because you’re leaving your comfort zone or because you’re staying in it. most people choose certainty over happiness, but don’t be most people. it’s only been within the past 5 or so years that i’ve gotten comfortable feeling uncomfortable. one of the best things i ever did for myself was force myself into situations that i didn’t want to be in. i was never a confident person but i always wanted to be. i can’t tell you why i wasn’t. it’s not one thing i can pinpoint, but i can tell you it was consuming. i also can’t pinpoint the time it all changed for me because it was gradual. it was small consistent changes that led to big ones. it was wanting it more than i was scared to fail at it. little secret about me…i signed up to get certified to be a group fitness instructor 3 times and didn’t show up until the 3rd sign up. that’s over $1k i threw out bc i was too scared. i also signed up to get certified to be a les mill bodypump instructor three times and didn’t show up until the 3rd go. another $1k out the window. signed up to be a spin instructor twice before i actually did it. i failed and failed and then failed again. but i failed because i was too scared to even try. and i will tell you it was hard to show up, terrifying actually, but it was harder to live with the possibility that i could do it and know the only person stopping me was myself. that pain is worse. transformation does not happen in your comfort zone. it happens when you push yourself beyond what is familiar. don’t stay still friends. you were meant to do more. the house with a yellow door and garage! our house is rendered! i really dislike the yellow door and garage, so i'm likely to complain for sometime so much progress in a week, i'm so happy. also got to meet our neighbours today face to face things are looking up finally. have a good weekend everyone i could really go for these views right about now it’s my favorite time of the week...pizza party friday night real quote from my fiancé, “i never knew someone could love pizza so much, until i met you.” @akashnpatel anyone else relate??

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗠𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗺𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘀𝘁 𝗣𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘅𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗦𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗸 claims to work as a concealer and foundation that mimics the natural finish of the skin. i love that this product comes in a stick form so it's great for quick or on the go application. it has a light to medium coverage that is buildable. it won't entirely cover my imperfections but i don't mind because it just gives the skin a more evened out, fresh appearance. i love wearing this as foundation on days where i am running errands and just need to look more put together. this does not work for me as concealer though. i have bumps under my eyes and occasional dry patches and this seemed to emphasize them. i also have dark circles so i prefer something with medium to full coverage. this foundation doesn't claim to be long-wearing but it wears fairly well on my oilycombination skin for up to about 7 or 8 hours before it starts breaking up on my chin. it does settle into my smile lines after a few hours though. when paired with a setting powder, it keeps my skin from getting too greasy and allows it to look naturally radiant. rating: 45 𝗙𝗹𝘂𝘀𝗵 𝗕𝗮𝗹𝗺 𝗖𝗵𝗲𝗲𝗸 𝗖𝗼𝗹𝗼𝗿 claims to give cheeks a luminous flush with a velvet finish that will last all day. the color i chose is a beautiful bronze shade. it applies very sheer on the cheeks and almost needs no blending since it's so sheer. it has a dewy finish that feels a bit tacky, not velvety. this might work well for someone who wants a very slight, barely there hint of blush. unfortunately, it isn't very buildable and doesn't wear well on me. i have tried wearing it both with and without setting powder and every time the blush disappears within an hour. sometimes, by the time i am done with my makeup the blush has already faded entirely. rating: 25 i am really curious to try out the tinted lip oils next. have you tried this brand? products pictured: @merit the minimalist perfecting complexion stick ochre @merit flush balm cheek color terracotta merit is available at @sephora now. sometimes you just gotta give yourself a hug ꜰɪᴇʀʏ ꜰʀɪᴅᴀʏꜱ hiit workout: split jumps criss cross tuck jumps burpees floor tap squat jumps push-ups i tend to work for 30secs with 30secs break x 4 rounds when doing hiit workouts. however, you can adapt this by doing 2040, 4020 etc. instead! make sure you land softly on the jumps to protect your knees! try and challenge yourself by doing the high intensity workout or build yourself up to it. have a fabulous weekend.

uhm yeah no. this product showed me that don’t ever settle for less in life okay, but on a serious note this micellar water made me realize how stripping and irritating other micellar waters i previously used were! since this has 7 types of ha its not stripping at all and is sooo much more nourishing while breaking down makeup or sunscreen. honestly, i’m already a huge fan of this. i love using this when i’m too lazy or tired to do a double cleanse at night. it’s efficient, quick and easy for those nights you just wanna jump in bed asap. also, i would like to say thank you rovectin for making the directions clear on how you should rinse this product off. in the western market, micellar water is seen as a swipe and done method in your skincare routine however leaving that product does a lot more harm. there’s a video by dr.dray on youtube and she explains it perfectly! link in bio to purchase! have you tried this product? what are your favorite micellar water? pr for an honest review friday mood someone pass me a mimosa stat what’s your fave cocktail?? you attract what you think “never give up” over the past few months my mindset has improved like crazy!! i am now becoming a more positive person, who has big goals i wanted brown french but they didn’t have it, soooooo you already know i ordered brown gel polish for next time hands up if you’ve booked reminisce! @reminiscefest booked for september. let’s hope we are on the tracks to getting back to normality and we can get back to doing the things we love salmon and broccoli pilaf we love finding different ways of cooking salmon, which is one of our favourite types of fish. this was certainly different and delicious! if you fancy giving it a go, it's a @waitrose recipe product review: @lanoliaskincare. today i will be reviewing products from lanolia a mother-daughter run skincare company aimed at helping people manage their skin conditions such as psoriasis. below i will be reviewing each of the four products: face time: when i got these products i was excited to try them, and i have been trying them out for a few weeks. i want to start off by saying that i love the texture of the face cream. it almost feels like the face cream is whipped and the texture of it is light. overall, i think it’s a great face cream, the first four ingredients are water, aloe juice powder, sunflower seed oil, and cetearal alcohol for slip. i think it was a great daytime face cream for me, at night i did need something more heavy duty, but this was a moisturizing cream nonetheless. hand care: this cream is my favourite out of the two creams face and hand cream. it makes for an amazing body cream, and makes you look very glowy which i loved. i will say that it has a strong fragrance from then lemon grass oil however, that was something i personally enjoyed since i do like a bit of fragrance. overall, loved this cream and how it made my skin feel and look. hush hush: this product i would say is more of a balm like the calm down product, however it is a little oilier in texture whereas the calm down is waxier in texture. this is meant to be a soothing anti-irritation product. i did get the least amount of use out of this item however i will say that due to the essential oils in this product i did see that sometimes my skin didn’t react well to this product depending on where i put it. but i did love the rosy smell it gave off, it reminded me a lot of lush and their products. calm down: this cream is more of a balm in my opinion and makes for a great moisturizer on my skin. i read a review that said it is a great lip balm, so i have been using it every night and i will say that it has been amazing for my lips. even in the dry winter my lips feel soft after i put this on. i also put some of this on after i waxed and it really did help calm down my skin. @lanoliaskincare has a great story behind them continued in the comments. spring 2021 we’re all about the pastel colours. my wardrobe is giving me vibes at the moment i can’t wait to show you all but for now this knit jumper is @hm the skirt is @nastygal couldn’t decide so here’s 3 pics of me for every one of your moods this view is the same every time but i’ll never be over it glass stackers with bamboo lid, 2 tier. for you hot chocolate lovers instead of tea and coffee friday's featured single is reuniøn new single 'before i forget'! encapsulating and emotional, ‘before i forget’ is a touching track with a cinematic sound... discover more about the single via the link in our bio! friday faves aloha and happy friday everyone! hope you’re all doing well. i sincerely apologize for not being as active recently as i’ve been going through some things. i appreciate all of you and thank you for your continued love and support! wishing you all a happy weekend! i was kindly gifted the matcha chia facial cream and cleansing cream from @kitaomatchausa @globalmediapr @ultabeauty the facial cream contains matcha green tea which is a great antioxidant and the chia seed supposedly helps to fight aging free radicals. the texture is thick and luxuriously creamy. i was worried it might be too heavy for my skin but it wasn’t. my skin has been enjoying this a lot. my skin has become hydrated and looks brighter since using this daily. the facial cleansing cream also contains the same benefits. i have been using this as my first cleanse to remove my sunscreen. it is creamy and does not emulsify much like oils and balms but it does leave my skin feeling cleansed and hydrated. i have enjoyed this as an alternative to my usual products. overall, i was pleasantly surprised at how much i enjoyed both of these products. i would purchase both and recommend them especially for those with drier skin. prgifted have you tried anything from kitao and have you enjoyed it as much as i do?

where do you want to see yourself? key word is you, what do you want? and if the answer is to get that job, to be a particular position of power, inspiration, to be recognised etc whatever it may be. i want you to know you are more than capable because those thoughts and ambitions are there for a reason, it’s plants in you. the irony is that it is fear and self doubt that cuts this dream short or brings tremendous delays in getting you to your goal, if anything. it’s what your soul wants, where you feel happy and you are robbing yourself of all that, if you allow doubt to set in, its not worth it. next time if you feel any doubt, acknowledge it and go do it anyway. take the natural course you were meant to take and it will all fit into place and hey if doesn’t work out after putting 100 in, what else is stopping you, then work on that. the most important thing is you don’t give up on what you want for yourself. we all have the capability to do anything we want to in the world. by being the best version of ourselves we can be. gemstone girls shineruby and cobaltshop them now be the energy you want to attract happy friday loves! day dreaming of the places we will visit when the world is back to normal ish. obviously the zoo safari park, with a smidge of bowling and allllllll the meals out. then there’s all the little things like swimming that i forgot even existed rip my bank balance i remember this day vividly. i drove into downtown vancouver from burnaby and had a hard time finding somewhere to park. i finally found a place and it started to rain. i had to walk five blocks in my short ass dress and kitten heels with no umbrella a tragedy i was glad when i reached the entrance of holt renfrew. i found my way to the cafe and met up with a friend for brunch. i love me a good brunch and a reason to dress up after brunch ya girl did a lil photo op and went to the cute ladurée stand for the famous macarons. i hear they are flown in from france. circa november 2018 in what ways has the weather disrupted or tried to mess with your outing?

setting intentions!! no workout post today, just a reminder to set your intentions. it doesn't have to be at the start of the week! there's an overused notion of starting fresh at the beginning of the week. while that can be a good tool for centering yourself, it is also used too often as an excuse for slacking off until the set restart day. it doesn't have to be all or nothing set intentions, both in fitness and in general life, that are reasonable and sustainable! personally, this week was relatively chill for me with school so i didn't have many set intentions, other than to go with the flow, rest, and start mentally preparing for my upcoming week, which is going to be much tougher. on top of my usual law class and homeworkreading, i have a 4 day trial team competition next thurs-sun and i'm moving apartments by myself this sunday since my wifi isn't going to be set up until wed, i'm also going home for a few nights in the middle of all of this! so, what are my intentions?

like, whoa! this photo is a perfect depiction of how i feel in realizing the truth of this saying. there is so much joy in watching these guys grow and discover themselves. i cannot wait to see what kind of young men they become, and get so excited about creating new memories with them. at the same time, it's bittersweet. i want to record every funny joke, exciting milestone, family vacation, and life lesson learned... because years from now, it will become a blur. exhibit a. singapore, circa 2016, apparently so let me ask ya'll... what do you use or do to storeorganize your memories?

before i answer this, here's what happened, exactly 02 years ago, back in 2019, i read this book titled you by caroline kepnes and was mind blown by how differently unique, creepy and steamy it was, not to forget a book full of movie and book references and recommendations, it was a win win book and contrary to popular belief, i sympathized with joe goldberg. then a few months later, i decided to give the netflix show a look, and i got pretty annoyed at how dirty they did the book, it was disappointing for us readers. at this point, i was aware of the sequel, yet i put it off for another day because of what the show did to my heart. to 2020, and season 02 of you was released, i wanted to watch the show from the pilot and it was okay, not bad, good in it's own way, but then comes season 02 and i'm absolutely in love, with the plot, at how comical it was in a dark way and with victoria pedretti, she was a sight to behold, plus the whole la vibe was on another level. fast forward to 2021, the poster for s03 is out and i read the sequel, to be disappointed and mind blown at the same time. i liked the plot and love's character arc and backstory from the show, and that first meet, the show did it so good, but the book is way more realistic and screams our thoughts out. excerpts of which i will post in a while. to answer my question, both were good, each in it's own way, but i like the books the most because of how relatable the words are. i hope i don't read the next sequel next feb. overall rating: 4.15 i love baking with my sweet girl. it’s one of our favourite things to do together i was hoping to get some one on one time with her today but livi has decided she would rather not nap the past couple days so she joined in the fun! i pretty much let em do this all on her own. she peeled and mashed the bananas, measured and added each ingredient, stirred and even put the muffin tin in the oven! she’s pretty proud of herself we’re going to take some muffins over to her auntie and uncle later because the best part about baking is sharing what you made! swipe to see the many faces of emma-may love a denim button down..... this one is @ralphlauren from about two seasons ago. i usually wear this buttoned up and tucked in but this time i just wore it open as an over shirt. ps. i used one of my past tiktoksreels for this outfit so go check it out for links to similar styles sometimes we hold on tightly to our burdens. this is a reminder to let them go. god can handle them, is more than able to handle them and wants to handle them full video out now ewartists beeswax small candle added to etsy shop beeswax small candle added to etsy shop pink dream my happy place yet another parking garage pic for your feed happy friday bbys! vibes for the day:️ cant go wrong with chanel sweet sweet saturday. wishing you rest for your mind and body post-workout glow. swipe to see my sadistic act of filming my 45-sec plank. also, swipe to see my set today. excuse my lounge room, it is a work in progress. cool people smile with @caranihcona shot @florian.schoenfeld i really admire colorful and unique hair colors. many people consider them unprofessional, but i think colorful hair shows a lot of positive character traits. confidence in your decision making, willingness to stand out, and a bit of creative flair is there a crazy hair color you’d love to try out if it weren’t for your job?

𝙾𝚕𝚊𝚙𝚕𝚎𝚡 𝙽°𝟹 𝙽°𝟶 olaplex is a cult favorite receiving constant praise for it's ability to repair extremely damaged hair. after hearing rave reviews and doing my own research i decided to try the brand. i had platinum blond hair for over 2 years and it definitely did a number to my hair. i take good care of my hair so my hair stayed healthier than most people that bleached as much as i did but it was definitely noticeable. my hair was dry and brittle with alot of breakage. i really hoped by using these it would help with the damage. n°0 $28 usd contains the highest amount of their bond builder and helps to repair damage. n°3 $28 usdalso repairs the hair bonds and strengthens them. i have been using n°0 on dry hair saturating it, then leaving it on for 10 minutes. i then put n°3 over the top of it and leave it for at least 10 minutes before i wash my hair. this is an amazing combination! i've done about 4 treatments so far and i have noticed such a big difference! my hair feels so much stronger and healthier. it's nowhere near as brittle as it was and i'm very impressed by the results. i would highly recommend this to anyone that has damaged hair or breakage, it's been incredible for me! have you tried @olaplex what are some of your favorite hair repair products?

you can be a work in progress and a masterpiece at the same time? mmm, it’s good right? but i’ve lost sight of some of my more masterful parts in the last week. and a lot of what i see is my lack of progress. i guess what i’m saying is this: here’s my progress, and here’s some of what it looks like while i’m working towards being a healthy girl, and according to the healthy part of my brain, this is also me as a masterpiece. let me know if you just need someone to talk to. and don’t any of you come at me for my inability to wear more than two of my two million sweatshirts. xoxoxo she let me take a picture of her today on our beautiful walk and i didn’t have to bribe her or pay her. but only one!! swipe to see what it’s like trying to photograph a preteen. i’m pretty sure she may have mentioned to our friends “this is what i have to deal with”. all with rolling eyes and attitude in the tone. i took time today, a moment to just appreciate, that despite the stress, the attitudes, the messes, all of it, i am so grateful for my babies. life is so short. time is fleeting. don’t let the constant monotony get in the way and make sure to take those moments just to hug your babies extra tight. happy friday friends! how was everyone’s week??
