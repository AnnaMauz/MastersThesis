if you’ve been on the same home routine for 4 months and not got the result you want you should probably change it up. following nutrition advice for ever and still not in control? maybe you’ve been in the same job for a decade and there is no sign of promotion or pay rise? how many times have you started something new following the same process you always follow and you haven’t gotten the result or made it to the finish line? if something isn’t working change it. you can’t keep repeating the same tasks and expect a new result it’s like hoping that if you keep throwing the chicken in the air one day it might fly. think about it pre register for our next 12 week intake now, doors open july 31st! 30 days to healthy living day 12! this morning's breakfast! this morning's smoothie consisted of the following....almond milk, 2 scoops of strawberry protein, sachet of digestion plus, half a scoop of fibre support, frozen strawberries and chia seeds! very yummy and filling!!! not forgetting the delicious herbal tea too of course!!! i know that weight is always a topic for people, but i want to switch that to health. these are my results from my 15 day restart. in just 15 days, i gained health and now i am dedicated to the change. change takes longer than 15 days, but be patient, trust the process, and be healthy. i will be doing this again, starting on aug 3rd. i do look better, but i feel better. weight is just a number, but health is how you feel day to day. i want to be better and feel better. reach out to me if you are interested or have any questions. ill be sharing my next 15 day journey as well. love yourself, you're beautiful and healthy i enjoyed being part of this video! love it! everyone should have fizz in their life. want to see what all the fun is about?

“i don’t know how to stick with these changes, because my husband is still eating anything everything!” one of the most common questions statements amongst our female clients. and to be honest, unfortunately there is no magic answer to get them on board, but there is something that @drewbland says that will help and that’s consistency. how many diets have we tried? quick fixes? skinny teas? workout programs we started and never finished? studies show 73 of americans start a new healthy routine, but never follow through. our spouses see us trying and failing first hand, it’s no wonder they don’t want to jump on board with every new program we try. by you sticking with this for yourself and your health is what will show your spouse you’re really in this for the long haul and you’re doing it for you. not for them, not to look like the girl on instagram, not for vacation.. but for life. i started this process of changing my lifestyle to a more clean, green, holistic approach in march of 2019. when i went grocery shopping for the first 2-3 months i was buying completely different things for both myself and for drew and that was okay! i just kept telling myself i’m doing this for me. around month 4-5 we were able to start blending our groceries and meals together a little more. he was seeing first hand what these changes were doing for my mood, hormones, and digestion health. it was then that he really became intrigued and wanted to learn more. by december of 2019 we were officially buying groceries again that both of us enjoyed, but that also followed the new standard of living principles we put in place to follow. july 2020 and we are officially a 90 plant based family and we strive to get the majority of our calories through fruits, vegetables, and complex carbohydrates. we strive to create a cleaner and greener way of living everyday from our nutrition to our living environment. i never knew if, when, or how long it would take us to get to this point, but wow has the journey been worth it! tgif!!! and why not have some purple in my life on a beautiful day! blueberry banana shake to start off day 5! so i know a lot of people think that work in the direct sellers market are trying to “scam” you or for some reason are trying to lead you down a path of deceptive. i am so proud of for being a company that continues to flourish and use their products for good! last year arbonne was and now they are on the global 100! the purpose of the global 100 is to showcase the true impact of this channel on people’s lives as well as the economic impact direct selling companies make on the communities they serve! if you are interested in learning more about what makes this company such a special place for me and many others, i’d love to chat more! comment below or dm me for more information!! visit earnings.arbonne.com for more information july giveaway i am so excited to gift this bio-hydria giftset away to all new preferred clients! preferred clients are the vip’s of arbonne! it’s only $29 to sign up for the entire year! you get every single item on the website for 20 off! plus 40 on all value packs! it is sooooo worth it! reach out to me by friday, july 31st @eleanaarbonneconsultant if you want to be a pc, and i will send this amazing bio-hydria set right to you! by signing up as a preferred client with me by july 31st, with this giveaway you’ll receive arbonne’s bio-hydria gel cleanser bio-hydria liquid serum bio-hydria gel cream bio-hydria eye gel hydration, hydration, hydration! these summer must-haves are great for all skin types! leaving your skin healthy, hydrated, and with that dewy glow! trust me... your skin will thank you! so excited for this weekend with my best gal @michalamerlino got in yesterday afternoon and ready for a full weekend of fun and loving on her! we are stocked and ready!! more photos to come!! our speak volumes mascara truly does it all! it lengthens, defines, curls and volumizes with the flexibility to go for a natural look or layer for bolder, more dramatic volume. have you tried this fan favorite yet?

@ossiegracewellness microbiome sleep cycleagain we see one of those circular functions between the microbiome and the body's main functions such as sleep. research is now showing that poor sleep disrupts the circadian rhythm which in return has a destructive effect on the gut. likewise, a poor gut environment is also showing to disrupt the circadian rhythm which is important for inducing quality sleep. sleep is the body's time for restoration and the gut relies on this time. become a triple certified holistic gut health and mindset coach this year!

love fiston a little less than a year ago i said yes to becoming an independent consultant with arbonne. in that year i’ve earned my power of 10 hat and power of 25 necklace. i’ve also promoted to district manager and met some life long friends. this journey i am on is so much more than a side hustle. it’s about crushing limiting beliefs, sharing what i’m passionate about and being a leader. it’s about being brave! i aim to lead with authenticity, energy, and showing up every single day. through my business i am able to serve others on a level that i never imagined. i want to thank every single person who has supported my business, believed in me, and hosted a party. this next year i have big goals for my business. my number one goal is to lock arms with ambitious women who are ready to step outside their comfort zone, be challenged, and have fun! keep flourishing babes! keep up what your doing, it all pays off one way or another. achieving your goals and learning along the way is what makes you stronger. this will also allow you to lead by example and help motivate others to overcome there own challenges. working from home just got a whole lot better! these protein pancakes made with arbonne essentials cinnamon roll protein shake mix look like something you'd get at your favourite brunch spot.⠀ @marissaswholelife ingredients:⠀ 2 scoops arbonne essentials cinnamon roll protein shake mix⠀ 1 banana 1 scoop whole food multivitamin blend⠀ 1 cage-free egg make it vegan by using flax egg or another egg substitute⠀ 13 cup any nut milk⠀ flaxseed and cinnamon instructions: mix until pancake batter consistency⠀ pour into a frying pan and cook⠀ top with vegan cream cheese, cashew butter, banana and sugar cookie seasoning from @primalpalate i kept the cover photo for the lols no toxicity here ‘everything means nothing if i ain’t got me’. growing up i listened to whitney, aleisha, celine, and many many more artists who sang about needing someone in our lives to complete us. i am a hopeless romantic at heart and listening to songs about not having anything, not being able to live without someone else created this need deep inside me- a need to find someone who would make me happy and give me this perfect life. in fact, this idea of dependence on another for happiness and purpose, ruined me! no other person could ever make me happy or complete and i often blamed them for not being able to do this. the answer to my happiness and life of meaning, it turns out, was not to be found in anyone else but me. i mean everything to me and without me- believing in myself and trusting in my abilities, i would have nothing! i was reminded of this because of my older daughter. she has the same love for music as i do. over the last week or so, she decided to seek out and memorize 3 songs, of which she wanted to perform. as she was listening to aleisha keys, if i ain’t got you, it all came flooding back. all the ideas about relationships and dependence that dominated my belief system for so long.so like a good mom, i broke it down for her and explained that if she had love and belief in herself then she would never have nothingan incomplete life. like any other 8 year old, she gave me the look and said, ‘mom it’s just a song’. a lesson for another time, maybe whowhat did you listen to growing up? did you also get seduced into thinking that someone else was going to fulfill all of your dreams and make you happy? why are so many people living their life and just ‘dealing’ with being uncomfortable? why aren’t we thriving to live our best lives and not be worrying about fatigue, dry lips, irregular toilet trips, gaining weight, skin rashes, and anything more! it’s so crazy how much our society just learn to live with all these issues going on in their body, without actually thinking why? why is it happening? how much better would i feel if these issues went away? how can i make these issues go away? so many people suffer in silence with most of these problems, and don’t be ashamed or embarrassed, just change it! sometimes we don’t realise that our body only reacts to what we put in it and on it. for example if you eat nothing but fried food and rubbed yourself in cooking oil every night, you’d look a lot different to if you ate nothing but vegetables and put pure, vegan, zero chemical cream on. i’m 100 sure you’d feel a lot different too! if you’d like some free advice on what you could possibly change to your lifestyle to give you a better quality of life, don’t hesitate to give me a message, i’d love to help you happy friday everyone! anyone got anything nice planned for the weekend? today the makeup i am wearing is: arbonne face primer. arbonne perfecting liquid foundation honey beige arbonne bronzer hd brows high definition palette smashbox full exposure mascara kiko fusion lipstick smart rimmel match perfection silky loose face powder smashbox cali kissed highlighter this is a favorite! chocolate protein powder i used arbonne single packets today 12 banana milk or almond milk pb2 ice collagen david samson⁠ https:www.facebook.comenroutewitharbonne⁠ looking for a daily skincare regimen to protect and maintain healthy-looking skin? try re9 advanced prepwork, an effortless, effective skincare line for the busy girl on-the-go. featuring ingredients like sustainably harvested kakadu plum and raspberry ceramide, it’s the perfect line to help preserve a youthful glow while protecting skin from external stressors. what’s your favorite product in the line? forgiveness. i’m not talking about forgiving others here; i’m talking about self-forgiveness. at some point in our healing process we all need to realize that part of what is keeping us stuck is that we all stubbornly cling to our old judgments regarding how we handled things once upon a time. for many of us it will be our child self that we are so critical of. why can we not accept that, as a child, we did the best we could to nurture that hurt child so we can heal and finally be at rest? our attitude towards our self binds us to our past and cannot be vanquished until we forgive ourselves for our so-called mistakes. real or imagined, it makes absolutely no difference. until we can forgive ourselves the progress is blocked. the same is true if our guilt and offense are the result of our adult choices. we still need to forgive ourselves to be free to heal and move on. so it looks like we are going to have to find a way and i know we can because anyone that truly wants to can. the sooner we find the love and courage to forgive ourselves, the sooner we all can get on to that life worth living we’ve been working on. a happy and present life full of peace and serenity is waiting on you! 𝐈 𝐰𝐚𝐧𝐧𝐚 𝐬𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐬𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐲𝐨𝐮. before arbonne i didn’t have a skincare routine. i was grabbing random stuff from shoppers, the body shop and so on. i was very inconsistent and i didn’t know i could find a routine that would fit into my life. i needed something that didn’t take anytime at all. introducing the calm skinline. the calm skincare line is for sensitive skins, the extra gentle calm skincare line hydrates, comforts and soothes with the kindest ingredients. aloe vera, cucumber, licorice, mallow, chamomile and sea mayweed soothe, comfort and moisturise the skin. while japanese green tea contains antioxidants to protect and heal. ​the extra-gentle formulas help soothe easily irritated, sensitive skin by providing hydrating relief, free of fragrance and colour. includes: gentle daily cleanser gentle daily moisturiser soothing facial serum soothing eye gel cooling rollerball i choose this one because it takes no time at all and it doesn’t irritate my skin. when you look good you feel good. i love this product and i love this brand. did i mention arbonne is all natural: this means no animal products or by products no animal cruelty no artificial flavours or sweetners hydroquinone hydroquinone is a skin lightener that causes skin irritation and may be linked to certain cancers. parabens some parabens have been linked to endocrine disruption, which may increase the risk of certain cancers. therefore, we do not use any parabens, including ethylparaben, butylparaben, isobutylparaben, isopropylparaben, methylparaben, and propylparaben. petrolatum petrolatum, commonly known as petroleum jelly, is a skin protectant that is a by-product of petroleum. it typically contains the impurity polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs, which have been linked to cancer. phthalates are plasticizing ingredients commonly used in fragrances as a solvent and skin fixative. phthalates have been linked to endocrine disruption and may cause birth defects. this is natural sustainable living. good for you and your environment. current favourite morning pick me up. watermelon fizz stick digestion plus arbonne’s fizz sticks are a great alternative to coffee, energy drinks and fizzy drinks. they taste great and they’re amazing if you struggle with anxiety because they won’t make you feel on edge and you won’t experience the crash you’d experience when having energy drinks. digestion plus is a personal favourite. it is not a magic cure but as someone who struggles with ibs and has tried a few diets and treatments for it, this product has changed my life. i’ve started seeing changes from the first week, my ibs attacks have reduced and i’m not painfully bloated 247! all products are vegan, cruelty free and formulated without gluten so a great choice if you want to start a new healthier journey. for more info leave a comment, send me a message or link in bio. happy weekend!

@fittpittsburgh @eatlocalshopsmall 2206 when it all started. i joined arbonne. i never thought i’ll do anything like this because i never took self care seriously. if you know me, my daily routine was literally dart and coffee for breakfast, lunch and dinner. i would at least have one glass of wine almost every night then binge eat past midnight lol. my older sis @melaniasimone joined arbonne earlier in the year btw she smashed it!! and i always found myself looking forward to her daily vlogs. i clearly remember on her day 19 i randomly, without thinking, reached out to her and ordered myself a package. fast forward to today, i’m so glad i did reach out because this journey taught me hard self discipline and a whole different side of me that i never thought i was capable of. it’s so crazy how our mental, emotional, spiritual and physical well being all connects. as mentioned in my last slide of this post, i was contemplating sharing results because i wasn’t impressed with my results. i told myself if i lose 10kilos i’m the fckn man lol but i just fell short and i was bitter to myself. long story short i was reminded by my loved ones how important it is to be kind to yourself and so i did and i am because i would never expose myself like this overall i lost 9.1 kilos in 30 days thank you so much to my friends and family esp my pt @lipomika @siemum2 for pushing me to be better and in return i will continue this journey for a better and healthy living dreaming of this magical place!

let me take a minute here and tell you all about how i became involved in the best kept secret that isn't even a secret arbonne! as most if you know, i am a mother to 3 amazing adult children and a grandparent to 3 beautiful grandchildren. i've been working in the community sector for over 5 years now, and my role consists of helping support people to connect, change and grow. during my time in this position, it has increase my altruistic urge to help people flourishing grow in all aspects of their lives with these incentives i found arbonne. arbonne was introduced to me by a family member, who wanted to share her knowledge of botanically-based products and the benefits of having a healthy lifestyle. i was asked to try the re9 skincare range, and at this time, i didn't have a consistent skincare regime so this was all new for me. after using the skin care products for a year i could see and feel a noticeable change with my skin. during one of my massage appointments, i spoke about how amazing my skin felt to sara gregg- who also happens to be a good friend of mine as well as my masseuse. we would have many conversations around the ingredients used in the products and the benefits of the business. i've been looking for some time to connect with a community that aligns with my values and beliefs around helping people and communities to flourish. arbonne also offers the opportunity to create a better work life balance to be able to give me more flexibility and freedom to enjoy what's really important to me. i'm so excited to be able to share with family and friends a vegan online business that has the best quality skincare make-up and nutritional products to help support people live healthier and happier lives. friday 0724 is international self-care day, perfect day for some have a great weekend amigos!

so much hydrating serum left in the packet to apply to your skin afterwards and it gives you the best glow! international self-care day we all need a little self-care every now and then. how do you reset and take care of yourself? in every aspect in life. i love this quote, and wanted to share it because it works for me as a good reminder to enjoy the journey of any endeavour in life. because sometimes we tend to want something so much, we just focus on getting the result, we want it immediately, but growth means change, and change takes time, so imagine if we were not enjoying that time? we would be basically missing in life and in opportunity i like to think about it this way when i feel the automatic pilot mode is taking over, i think this happens to us all at some stage and it is normal. but how good it feels when you are present and mindful of every moment, knowing it is a step towards a goal whatever it is, small or big, it is taking you closer, every consistent action, every day, it is lived to its fullest. life goal, everyday, every moment, every step and every fall. posted @withregram @chelseaswisher.hair.health am i constantly tired? yes am i staying awake when i should be sleeping? also yes thank god for ️fizz️!!

“if not now, then when?” whenever i feel doubt creeping in, i repeat this to myself and it changes everything. i don’t remember who said it, but i know how i came across it. that’s the thing with personal development… it’s a slow climb and then one day you start hearing things that resonate with you and it changes your life see for years i always waited for the perfect circumstances. i waited until i felt perfectly rested, until my kids were perfectly behaved, until naptime was longer, until my mind was clearer, until my body was smaller, until i wasn’t so “busy.” the thing is, there’s no such thing as the “perfect time.” you’ll never be all the things, all at the same time, exactly when you need the strength to push past your comfort zone. you need to do it anyways you need to create your perfect scenario by taking those uncomfortable steps and putting yourself out there!

i’m here to tell you that today is going to be a great day! that you are amazing,beautiful,loved,and worthy. don’t give up on yourself or your goals. often times it’s the hardest right before the breakthrough. one thing i love about the arbonne products is that you can use them any way you want i mixed my daily fiber boost in my yogurt i paired it with our herbal detox tea. taking care of my digestion and using this products is fun and delicious. daily fiber boost: get your fiber fix with 12 grams of fiber, nearly half the daily requirement, derived from grains, fruit and vegetables. is a flavorless, soluble fiber that can be added to all foods and beverages did you know that what you put in and on your body can impact the way your skin looks and your mind functions? a positive mindset can also impact the way we look because when you feel good physically and mentally, you look good too!

and here is my offering come hang out, it'll be yummy. how well do you know the products you’re using on your skin? do you know what ingredients are used? are they safe, are they ethical, are they good for our environment? before i was introduced to arbonne products, i honestly never even looked at what ingredients were listed. never even cared. i have learnt so much recently and very much check what i’m using now, especially on my family too. i was really quite shocked with some of the products in my cosmetic drawer, actually appalled. do yourself a favour and do a bit of friendly research on some ingredients you’re using, know what you’re using. fancy brands aren’t always the best brands unfortunately. arbonne maintains a list of over 2,000 ingredients that are not allowed in their products, that blows my mind. our products are also vegan and cruelty free and b corp certified just sayin. anyone else get extreme satisfaction finishing a product? i’m terrible for buying new products before finishing the old ones and then ending up with lots of almost empties. the past few months i’ve been making it my mission to use up a lot of open products without opening new ones first and i’ve found it so satisfying using that last little bit i don’t know what i look forward to more. reading the words which fill the chapters in preparation for our book club or being able to share the parts which touch on our hearts and inspire us to grow and be our best selves in such a supportive, safe space. i joined arbonne because the philosophy behind the products and the business opportunity was unmatched but i love arbonne because of the community of people it attracts. results are different for everyone. nothing is guaranteed. for typical earnings visit earnings.arbonne.com chocolate banana peanut butter shake for breakfast!! ask me how you too can have this healthy breakfast empowering each other everyday, i accept the challenge! @sharon1550 @nickyhalliday .we support encourage women to celebrate themselves. today you are you, that is truer than true. there is no one alive, who is youer than you”. llb ladies llb: life love beauty is now live on facebook. so what is this llb group i hear you ask?? following on from arbonne's 30 days to healthy living and the fact it has transformed my tummy it started me thinking more about what i put onto my skin as well as into my body. your skin is the bodies largest organ after all! it also made me think more about what products i am using on my clients. i want to provide you with skincare and makeup that nourishes your skin as well as making you look fabulous. i have used arbonne products before and had great results, so i went back to researchingtrying them. the fact they are clean, vegan and cruelty free is also win win win. it therefore felt like a no brainier to become an arbonne consultant. so back to llb, why have i named it this?... life sharing my life, all aspects food, drink, toddler, so on... love we all need to love ourselves a little harder and be kind to all those around us beauty sharing all my skincare and makeup tips and tricks i will be sharing with you the lovely arbonne products, but i want this group to be more than that. i want it to be a safe place for us girls to be able to speak, share stories and not feel pressure, be ashamed or embarrassed. if this sounds like a group you want to be part of let me know and we can get you added in. can’t wait to start the next challenge and to see how this helps everyone whatever your goals might be it’s not too late to join and if you’re the slightest bit interested pm me or comment below.... what have you got to lose with a 45 day money back guarantee? ￼feeling pumped. lifestylechange thanks to @minnielizzie for capturing this moment of pure happiness. most of the time, my inside does not match my outside. i battle anxiety like a war front on the daily. but in this moment, my sweet friend was able to capture this care free moment of complete happiness, high on life and the love of family and friends. this is the woman i strive to be every day. thank you @xoxolindzeee for challenging me to see myself the way this picture sees me i wanted to share my before and after literally a two month difference after years of struggle of using arbonne’s products.after trying everything on the market and completely giving up. arbonne entered my life and saved me. i am so thankful for arbonne for clearing my skin, succeeding in that healthily, and giving me confidence i thought i would never have for the longest time. healthy skin is achieved by consistently utilising effective skincare along with balanced nutrition. i was completely unaware of the toxic chemicals that are used in most skincare products and was shocked to learn that the majority of skincare products we use contain petroleum by-products, animal by-products and toxic chemicals, 125 of which have been linked to cancer and can also disrupt our endocrine hormone system. with arbonne we have the arbonne advantage not just because of the pure ingredients we do have, but also because of what we don’t include in our ingredients! most people aren’t aware of the low level toxins in their personal care products. did you know it takes just 26 seconds for what you put on your skin to reach every major organ in your body? the average woman uses around 120 chemicals a day on her face! music: remember musician: @iksonmusic sooo ignore the but i just wanted to share my results of using the re9 advanced prepwork overnight face jelly! i don’t think the picture does this product enough justice as my face has been glowing in the morning! it’s definitely a must have ⁣all products used are listed on video. product shout out: did you see the coverage a pea size amount of the cc cream gave me!? i have a feeling we're all going to emerge out of this period as a chef! here's one you can add to your at-home brunch repertoire: marble cake protein waffle! i go crazy for a good pair like brunch and waffles.⠀ ingredients:⠀ 2 scoops arbonne essentials marble cake protein shake mix⠀ 1 scoop daily fiber boost⠀ 1 scoop whole food multivitamin blend⠀ 1 cage-free egg make it vegan by using flax egg or another egg substitute⠀ 13 cup any nut milk⠀ instructions: mix until pancake batter consistency⠀ pour into a waffle maker and cook⠀ top with your favorite topping @hollyabel what’s your skincare go to??? my absolute fav is re9 advanced restorative set.. providing loads of hydration thanks to hyaluronic acid that acts as a cushioning and lubrication agent to lock in moisture.. wouldn’t be without this range now and of course the.. re9 advanced prepwork overnight face jelly.. pop this bad boy on your face before you hit the sack and let it recharge parched skin while you sleep. good morning, baby-soft skin!

start your new journey with me. start by doing the 30 days to healthy living next month, so you can experience first hand just how amazing arbonne really is. you will have amazing support throughout the 30 days! let’s do this! ‘be the change you wish to see in the world’ making new positive changes from my outlook, nutrition exercise, interests all impact in such a positive way. life can throw some surprises or hurdles at you but know that you can get over them. the changes i have been making with my own health and my sideline businesses have helped me to grow into a mature person and have a lease of life. i love to explore and have time to appreciate the small things in life. what do you like to do? sometimes we make these changes for the better and a better outlook on life. why should we be negative, why should we looks for problems. let’s remind ourselves how lucky we are and what we have and the opportunities we can be given in life big or small. four samples left- where am i sending these?!? comment to call dibs! tiᗰe to tᗩᒪk ᕼᗩᑎᗪᔕ did you know that there are three areas which start to show the signs of ageing more than any other part of your body? they’re around your eyes, your neck and your hands! more often than not, two out of those three areas are neglected; so we end up with a youthful looking face, but hands and necks that betray us! it’s important to note that these areas are constantly exposed to environmental factors contributing to the rapid ageing, so firstly protection is key! using spf and pollution shield technology can lessen the effects and slow down the process; however, our hands go through a different kind of stress altogether... washing! we, especially during times like this hello, pandemic alert are constantly washing our hands and using alcohol based sanitisers and wipes! this strips the skin on our hands of essential moisture, causing them to become dry and dehydrated which enhances the signs of ageing! i have become somewhat obsessed with hand creams, but i like many others, struggle to find the right one! i absolutely hate that greasy feeling residue that some creams leave behind, giving you the fear of touching anything for at least 30 minutes after applying because you just know it’s going to leave a mark! but at the same time, i want something that is actually going to moisturise my hands and make them feel super soft! over the years i have tried many hand creams, from nivea to clinique. creams that claim to remain on your hands even after washing; some good, some bad, some terrible! i could sit here and list them all, but i’m restricted to 2200 characters, so instead here are some of my favs pictured: @arbonne shea butter hand cream priced £19.00 for 85ml discounts available, link in bio for more info @nipandfab glycolic fix hand renew priced £5.99 for 75ml use 2-3 times a week at night @retinolskincare vitamin enriched anti-aging hand cream priced £14.99 for 100ml @algenist genius liquid collagen hand cream priced £36 for 50ml all four hand creams have something different to offer and this is by no means a definitive list. i’ll pop some more info in the comments below how many of these 5 are part of your daily routine? 1 healthy diet 2 30min moderate physical activity per day 3 healthy body weight 4 non smoker 5 low alcohol intake healthy habits make a difference in how long you will live!

make sure you’re treating yourself every now and then and try giving your husband a facial too they love it! i saved this to my phone a long time ago to reflect upon when i was learning the value of being underestimated. being underestimated is a driving force for me. i welcome it nowadays. i definitely don’t like the feeling it brings but i’ve learned to let it empower and inspire me. in the past it caused doubt and uncertainty. it ultimately prevented me from reaching my goals. the next time someone underestimates you, use it. don’t let it knock you down. let it drive you. you might just find out what your truly capable of. health support? accountability? people just don’t know where to turn right?! with all the conflicting information out there! this is because each body is different, and what works for one, may not work for another... so, if you check out the arbonne 30 days to healthy living info and it seems like a fit for you, join us!

link in bio for this routine xx day 15 is done. to be honest, i didn’t think i could make it to day 15. but i’m finding my rhythm and following the process. on to day 16! all time faves ‘if you are gonna blame people for all the shit, you better blame them for all the good too. if you’re gonna give them credit for everything that’s fed up, then you have to give them credit for everything that’s great. cause life is not so simple and black and white... if we can realise that life is always happening for us, not to us, game over. all the pain and suffering disappears.’ @tonyrobbins at the beginning of this month i was in a pretty dark place. an accumulation of a lot of things. as always, i turned to personal development and some key figures to enlighten me and remind me how to get back to myself. this clip from ‘i am not your guru’ really shifted something in me. something i’ve spent the rest of this month making peace with. it’s been such a challenging month. but i’m better for it i never had the greatest relationship with my dad. i blamed him for a lot of things in my life, whilst our relationship was mending his last few years it wasn’t completely whole. there were so many things i was still angry and hurt with him about when he passed. i’ve carried that anger and let it fester as fear within me for the longest time. lately i’ve been learning to let go of all that anger and fear. i’ve been learning that whilst i feel there was so much hurt and pain, it has shaped me into the person i am today. this clip in ianyg resonated so so much at the time as it made me realise i am who i am because of my upbringing and i’m stronger for that and wouldn’t have the incredible life i have today with out it. i just wish my dad had been around long enough for me to talk through all this with him. something tells me he knows rest up raymondo i love you we rise by lifting others. robert ingersoll @camhongpham @melliebean82 @meeaham @hello.lann how do we maintain health year round? no yo-yo dieting? no deprivation? no calorie counting? nada. it’s not a secret that we absolutely love the 30-days to healthy living. it really improved my digestive issues and it always makes brendyn and i feel great. i feel my best when i make health a priority. don’t you?! we’re no strangers to health, but for busy people like us, it helps sooooo much with staying on track and enjoying the process at the same time. sure we do treat ourselves here and there but it’s not an “addiction” we struggle with anymore. for us, the 30-days is our reset button it helps us detox from sneaky sugar cravings that creep in, it helps us feel more satisfied with our meals, and supports our organs in charge of detoxification. so cool! ahhh i just love it! i can talk about it all day! i can’t explain how happy i am that i am back cycling and swimming everyone always says to me ‘how do you get up so early?! i could never do that’ well it’s because i frikkin love it find something you love and you’ll stick to it, it’s all about consistency fuelled by my @ukarbonne of course too! thank you @davidlloydemersonsgreen it would be a travesty to be on your death bed realizing you never did what you truly wanted in life because someone told you that you weren’t good enough, smart enough, brave enough, fit enough, creative enough, strong enough or just plain enough. choose to let go of the judgement and live your life because you are enough. gooooood morning, happy tuesday i hope you’re all well. so today in our arbonne a- z is the letter f and f means fizz sticks woooooooooooooooooooooo. fizz sticks are the best replacement for coffee, energy drinks. they taste amazing look amazing and they give you a safe result. there’s no burn out or crash. they’re just beautiful. my daughter loves a fizz stick. they come in four beautiful flavours. citrus, pomegranate, strawberry and the new watermelon flavour so often people ask advice for how to find “the one“ we are relational beings, we are designed to be in relationship and yet, cannot be what defines us or makes us whole. i say start within. to remember that you are not waiting for confirmation from someone else that you are ok. no one can give that to you because “you are the one“ when we operate from our wound, we might approach dating and relationship as if it’s a performance. we show up the way we think will impress the other, or keep them interested. when we show up from a space of worth and wholeness, we operate from a place of personal power. it breaks my heart when i hear people express their deep loneliness and longing for a partner, all while wondering what they’ve done wrong or why no one is choosing them. there is nothing wrong with you if you’re single. there is nothing wrong with you if you haven’t been “chosen”. choose yourself. return to the seat of your power and remember that love is available in many forms beyond romantic attachment. we don’t get to control the timing of when our partners arrive, and how long we remain with them. no matter what, things come to an end and the work is to remain at home in ourselves. to find peace within and to claim the right to be happy, joyous and powerful with or without a partner. take this time to grow into yourself and find the place in you that already knows you are whole and complete. who else loves fizz sticks? i am literally obsessed with them i use them to help promote alertness, particularly when i’m working at my computer. if you haven’t tried them yet and want to know more, send me a dm or check out the website link in my bio disclaimer. typical results are different for everyone. results vary depending on individual effort, body composition, age, eating patterns, exercise, and the like. here is to delicious fizz sticks that help promote wakefulness, endurance enhance your energy levels. this little bubbly drink contains botanical blends of ginseng, guarana and green tea. add into the mix some vitamin b and you got yourself a naturally caffeinated drink i am honestly obsessed with this drink. i will have at least one a day. i love to drink them in the afternoon as they also help me with that 3 o’clock sugar cravings. fizz anyone the cherry blossom palette check out my beautiful birthday cake by @ellascakesandbakes sharing it with my family was the perfect end to the perfect day @ukarbonne wouldn’t mind spending my tuesday brunching with my girls again this is what almost 50 looks like this is what a late-night master's program student looks like this is what a corporate executive looks like this is what an @arbonne independent consultant looks like am i busy? just a smidge!! but i wouldn't have it any other way!!! good morning everyone it's time for my watermelon energy fizz drink! yum! hello world i just wanted to pop on here and say this year has sucked sooo much it’s been tough to come around some things in life! but with a great support team and great family i couldn’t be any more thankful arbonne has been actually the only good thing so far this year that helped me learn about myself and others it helped me by getting out of my comfort zone it helped me focus on helping people be the better version of themselves and it gave me a new family if you ever thought about joining arbonne. ask me anything you want no strings attached! my dms are open skip the signups! you will be automatically added to tomorrow’s event! health exists in all areas and they are all connected. when we feel healthy in one area, we desire it in another. they free flow. just as when we feel sluggish or a lack of health and vitality we feel it across the board. for example, if you start you day with healthy thoughts, feelings, movement then you'll likely desire healthy food and relationships. at the crux of it all is knowing you are worthy and deserving of true health, vitality and joy. there is nothing you need to do to deserve this. you simply do. you are here because you are worthy to be. yoᑌ ᑕᗩᑎ ᔕit ᗯitᕼ ᑌᔕ see those tummy rolls? that messy, cluttered corner on the left? see my energy lifeline in my hand? even with the perfect family faces on the wall, there is nothing perfect about us. we fight sometimes, we make up, we scream at the kids sometimes, we give them cupcakes for breakfast sometimes, we are late to things alot of the time but we know that all we have is each other so screw perfection! you imperfect? good, you're normal! you can sit with us [reflection]⠀ just one of them days today, i feel content but contemplative to need something is greater than to want it! what do you need? and what would you be willing to do to make it happen?⠀ please share, i really love the interaction with you lot, you always make me feel happier take moments of peace where you can. breathe in the clean air, listen to the birds and insects. be grateful for being this itty bitty soul having a human experience for such a short time on this seemingly insignificant rock spinning in the universe. don’t sweat the small stuff, think bigger!

𝘾𝙤𝙣𝙘𝙞𝙤𝙪𝙨 𝙚𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙣𝙜 this morning when i woke up. i felt a need to check in with myself and my inner garden of thoughts my relationship with myself. as i checked into my coaching lab class we were doing our rounds, i could still feel this emotional density within me that wanted to be brought to light and be acknowledged. the lovely @jessicapalmerofficial guided us through a ‘concious eating meditation’ as i relaxed and tuned in, i could see turbulent waves which represented my dense emotions and saw myself doing dancing which looked contemporary flowing with these title waves. i saw her face me she looked lost, overwhelmed as if she had trapped herself in this pattern which she knew was no good for her. it then lead to my connection with food and how the food i was consuming was impacting my mental, emotional and spiritual wellbeing. i then had visions of fruit and vegetables and watched myself happily cooking and preparing these meals with love, joy and appreciation, humming and dancing in the kitchen. i then had visions of the food i am currently consuming and my body cringed. i then continued on cooking and then blessed my food i had prepared and ate it my body celebrated my concious food choices i then danced again and twirled into a beautiful, strong, full and luscious green tree with deep roots into mother earth and felt deeply connected to her everyone’s body is different, you don’t need to follow the latest trend or diet. but listen to how your body reacts not the mind and your body will reveal the answers to you 𝗧𝗼𝘅𝗶𝗰 𝗳𝗼𝗼𝗱𝘀 𝗧𝗼𝘅𝗶𝗰 𝘁𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀 𝗡𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗶𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗳𝗼𝗼𝗱𝘀 𝗡𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗶𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀 nourishing my body today with my arbonne greens balance 34 rainbow fruit and vegetables and some more delicious and nourishing foods dm me for more details about getting your hands on some nourishing vegan arbonne products you wanna see what an actual hbic looks like in the wild? here’s a shout out to all my fellow badass friends who i admire so much for going after their dreams goals repost from @theskincarenut one question commonly asked is why should i invest extra money in vegancruelty free products? 5 words: they are better for you! compared to conventional skincare, vegan and cruelty free products offer many benefits that aren’t found in conventional skincare i am loving living healthy! i’m not much of a morning person, i’m a procrastinator, and i struggle with motivation. i let these be my excuses for far too long. “i can’t, i don’t have time to do all of that before work.” not a morning person- wake up earlier to make the time. “i don’t have time, i have to do all the things!” procrastinator- get organized, do all the things and find time. “i can’t do this anymore, it’s too hard, i need to make time for other things.” need motivation- community, get healthy with others and encourage each other! i have struggled with my health, succeeded, then struggled again. it’s tough, but i realized it was the choices i was making that made it tough. i had to get out of my own way. i started with community. my friend @emileehill invited me to join her in the @arbonne community. emilee has inspired me and motivated me. the encouragement and coaching from the team motivated me to get out of my own way and make time for my health. going through the 30 days to healthy living with @emileehill and my friend @kendalthefirst has taught me that if i make better choices, have a more positive mindset, i am never too busy to live a healthy life. i’d like to help through the struggle. how can i help you overcome your “i’m to busy because kia ora friends and family! my names shar and i’m an independent consultant with @arbonneaunz i have just started our 30 days to healthier living programme which will help me get healthy starting from my gut and mind, body and skin shall follow!

i have fallen in l o v e with this company, the community, and these products hi everyone! welcome to my insta page. i am julia and i am an arbonne consultant amongst many other health and well being areas i work in. i believe true health covers many areas and i love that i get to combine them all with the work i do in the world. i've jumped into arbonne at a time in my life where i feel ready to delve more into nutritional and skin health alongside the mental, emotional, physical and spiritual sides of health i already work in. if you'd like to know more about what i do you can also find me at @feelittohealit and @poppysfitness take the leap of faith. the truth is we aren’t really afraid of failure, but we’re afraid of people seeing us fail. don’t let other people stop you from pursuing your dreams. what’s really holding you back?? i’m so glad the lord gave me the opportunity and courage to say “yes” to this business. let’s chat about your hesitations fears. chances are, i’ve felt the same way!

oh hey babes link in bio @squishybebe skeptical moms wanted! have you been in or currently in a mlm home business? we're exposing a huge injustice, the reason why 85 of people quit and the simple solution to correct this. people quit because they can't find customers or new people to earn commissions. this is because many in leadership positions are more focused on their own success instead of helping and growing the people in their group. the answer to this injustice is a new marketing program that you're going love but your upline won't. we're looking for skeptical moms that don't want to sell or ask friends or family to help to check out our marketing program. we're claiming that it can almost guarantee success in any mlm business and we want your opinion. visit myhomebiz.net or send me a message for more details. washing my face at nights can be such a chore. these are the products i currently live by and use daily. i believe a skin regimen of sone kind is needed. like i've said before, i've always been obsessed with beauty and products. these are only a few this year i changed lines and decided to try arbonne, drunk elephant and caudalie. everyone's skin is different as are the needs. what are you using on your face? is there something else i should be trying that's not in my radar? i’m wayyyy too excited about this...i can’t wait until breakfast tomorrow!!!

the support and training i have already is crazy to what i had before! like night and day i don't feel like i'm just a check in a box for someone elses goal and its honestly refreshing. i promise to be real and genuine with you guys and these products...always. i can't wait to share this company and everything they stand for. stay tuned!

to do something that we love motivates us, excites us, makes us smile and fills us with energy, and so therefore: why don’t you seek what you really are passionate about? i knew at a young age that i wanted to help people. i knew it was my passion. as i grew older i was more influenced by health and wellness and that’s how i got into what i do now... i help others by reaching their health goals and living more meaningful and fulfilling lives are you passionate about your job? do you love what you do? keeping the same job, when we have the opportunity to change it is another way of being unfaithful to ourselves and to our happiness. we have to lose those fears that in most cases are unfounded. it is about living the best possible life and being the best version of ourselves @arbonnecanada week 1 of the @arbonne.official 30-day clean living challenge complete and down almost 5 pounds! i'm loving the weight loss, but loving the things i've gained so much more! no sugar cravings! no caffeine cravings! no bloating! abundance if energy! i can't wait to see what week 2 brings! 30-day my virtual launch party is still up til tomorrow. if you didn’t watch me live that is okay. my video along with @swakl is still up. i would love for you to watch both videos and tell me what you think. there is also a raffle, watch both videos for more information. thank you for the support and love. new stickers launch 819. who’s in love with this bon babe rose gold design?

makes for a perfect snack or dessert! this is my fav gluten-free, vegan recipe that i've tweaked many times and landed on this: 12 cup almonds pinch of sea salt 1 tsp vanilla 1 tsp cinnamon 2 scoops arbonne vanilla protein powder 12 cup shredded coconut 2 tbsp coconut oil 1 tbsp almond butter 1 tbsp rice malt syrup blend in food processor then add: 14 cup almond milk handful of cacao nibs or choc chips i pop them in the refrigerator and try not to eat them all in one day tag me or let me know if you make them! enjoy is so excited too! surprise!!!! healthy eating doesn’t have to be boring guys anyone for pasta? yes me, always. growing up in an italian family, getting together meant pasta dinners at my nana’s. my grandma passed down her love for cooking to my mom, and i like to think my mom passed that down to me and my sisters as well. if you know my mom you know she is a master in the kitchen, but nothing beats her homemade pasta sauce. adapted slightly to be 30 days approved, but ofc this comes from my italian mama i eyeball a lot of this so just do as muchlittle as you want! taste it and see how ya feel. in a blender add: 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes contadina are my mom’s fav 2 cloves of garlic healthy pinch of basil, oregano, salt, and pepper blend until the consistency is what you like, won’t take more then a few pulses poor into saucepan and add in some cooking wine, olive oil and fresh basil we have a plant on our porch if you do not have fresh basil just add a little more dry basil and let it simmer. the longer it simmers the more flavorful it will be! traditionally my mom will add sausage or meatballs to give the sauce even more flavor. if you’d like to find some 30 days approved options you can do that as well! today, i did not do that. delicious either way at this point the sauce may taste like it needs a little sugar! though, added sugar is not 30 days approved!! so you could add in a packet or two of stevia all natural plant based sweetener, you can try and find naturally sweeter crushed tomatoes or a sweeter cooking wine, or you can leave it as is! still is super yummy without a sweetener if you weren’t trying to make it 30 days approved you’d just add some white sugar! boil some water and add in your fav type of gluten free pasta! today i used brown rice and quinoa fusilli pasta from trader joe’s. garnish with more basil ofc. anyone else obsessed with the smell of basil? serve and enjoy thank you @fashionistatheart @brandygilbreth @courtnnnie @delaneyburgg loving this @arbonne cherry blossom makeup, cousins with cute clothes to borrow @havesomefaith2 handmade clay earrings from @sweetmagnoliaco a fun summer filter! tea time i never thought i’d be a tea drinker, but here i am drinking arbonne’s herbal detox tea almost every night. i love that is caffeine free and is healthy for me. healthy from the inside out yummy we’re not just a forex, stocks, binary, and crypto trading company. we’re an innovative company that offers: free income producing apps documented results global top traders 70 discounts on travel bonus travel cash restaurants discounts book excursion right from your computer discounts on cruises yachts luxury rideshare app global telecommunications app professional development, mentorship elearning program optional weekly affiliation program company luxury trips bentley lamborghini rank achievement program much much more we’re just getting started and you still have the opportunity, to join us on the founders level and not on ground level! inbox me today for more info! thank you for choosing me @pcast79 @torresl01 curly hair style @arbonne my dessert is healthy?! yes please!!!! swipe for recipes peace out junk foodi have not had healthy habits when it comes to food and the older you get the more you feel these unhealthy habits. two kids later and 30 lbs heavier i’ve decided to change that! thanks to the sweet mama @margo.lloyd who has all the tips and tricks and hilarious full of energy @clarejrector for the inspiration!!! i’m one week in and right on track for me and for my family paid another bill today and i just started! join me!!! yah smoothie for my morning breakfast which tastes amazing!

what does your look like? challenge accepted! thanks for the nomination @monica.croatt restocked a few summer essentials for our camping trip next weekend when it's been raining for days it's such a treat to feel the sun on my face.⁣ just a small amount of sunshine can improve your mood, sleep, immunity, metabolism, heart health and the vitamin d is important for strong bones and teeth and it has so many more benefits.⁣ did you get some sunshine today?⁣ are you a wahm? juggling responsibilities of kids work? i love the flexibility, the ability to say yes and be spontaneous but sometimes you can end your day and think “what did i get done?” some tips i’ve found helpful in keeping my day on track and getting work done and having fun with the kids! wake up before your kids, if you don’t run the day, your day will run you prep dinner while you make breakfast postpone online shopping all scrolling till after kids are in bed clean up house after work...or before you know it you’re cleaning all day avoiding the work that pays the bills if both parents work get a house cleaner-- non-negotiable these are rules i have in place to make sure i grow my business and avoid the “where did my day go syndrome?”! if you are a wahm, i would love to hear any tips you have to make your day work for you? doesn't narrowing down a specific ideal client mean that i'm not selling to everyone i can? i don't want to leave money on the table. here's the truth: your company may indeed offer something for everyone, and your product might actually help people of all ages... but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't niche down. it all comes down to your message. consider how you would market to a 21-year old college student who is making the most of her legal drinking age by spending every night at the bar, singing karaoke, and competing with her friends to see how many free drinks they can have sent over by interested guys. imagine the verbiage you would use, how you would relate to her, and the benefits of your product that you would highlight. now imagine using that very same verbiage with a 45-year old, overweight, perpetual dieter, married mother of 4 who attends bible study every wednesday night, book club every 1st tuesday of the month, and sits in the stands at the soccer field watching her kids games for a minimum of 6 hours each week. would the same selling points work? nope. if you want to grow your client base, you've got to stop speaking to the masses. get specific and speak clearly and concisely to your ideal client! focus on the problem that you can solve with your product or service. speak to that problem colorfully, show her that you understand how it feels to have that problem, and then offer the solution. so which ideal client should you pick to focus on? the one that you can speak most authentically to. we all tend to serve a former version of ourselves, so think about the client that you can most relate to, the one who you know in your soul that you can help with your product, because of your firsthand experience in her shoes. what questions do you have about getting clear on your ideal client? puppies and arbonne! f i z z. t i m e. who needs a boost of energy, endurance, and alertness in their daily life? message me about how you can get a free box of my go to natural energy drink! looking to start or grow on your health journey. it doesn’t have to be stressful! join us august 3rd and feel...i mean see for yourself. do it for you!!!!!! so excited!!! 15 min zoom party on sunday, august 2nd at 7pm cst! there will be numerous giveaways provided! dm me or comment below if you want additional information on how you can join and be entered for some awesome giveaways!!! there’s nothing in this world that makes me happier than being your mama check out my quick and easy morning skincare routine with amazing @arbonne products. pretty natural look today i used my arbonne bio hydria gel cream moisturiser arbonne speaks volumes mascara arbonne shape it up brow pencil in light arbonne matte shine lip duo in fleur want to know what’s even better then the fact that i bought it from my own business?

we're exposing a huge injustice, the reason why 85 of people quit and the simple solution to correct this. people quit because they can't find customers or new people to earn commissions. this is because many in leadership positions are more focused on their own success instead of helping and growing the people in their group. the answer to this injustice is a new marketing program that you're going love but your upline won't. we're looking for skeptical moms that don't want to sell or ask friends or family to help to check out our marketing program. we're claiming that it can almost guarantee success in any mlm business and we want your opinion. visit myhomebiz.net or send me a message for more details. sweat. smile. repeat. let’s be real, life has been a bit crazy. i’ve been in a weird funk lately and have gained about 15lbs since may. my weight has always been up and down it is time to get back into our routine of working out 2 workouts a day including 8 miles with a weighted vest and eating clean... i’m less than a week in and already down 5lbs {probably the 5lbs of gluten my body rejected already feeling more like myself again, thank goodness for a partner who is always down for getting healthy again... mentally and physically! who’s with me?

realtor headshots! how gorgeous is she?! hair and makeup by me headshot by @couchadventures maybe you need to lose yourself so that you can find yourself again. i will never stop telling you all we’re i came from. it’s important to know we all start somewhere and we all go through things. if your path doesn’t seem to have a direction right now that’s okay because mine didn’t either. i thought many times i know there’s something more for me but i didn’t know what. i did not want to serve for the rest of my life. i didn’t want to work for someone to else. but i constantly felt stuck. felt like i wasn’t moving. i think we all get lost at one point, we don’t feel like we’re going anywhere, but than something happens. an opportunity comes our way and we get nervous and back out. if you want to change your path, if you want true direction and if you want to feel like you have this purpose, you have to dig down and ask yourself what truly makes you happy. what lights you up? you can be lost, but taking opportunities that come your way, is one of the best things you can do to feel truly found again. weekend away with the goonies the 30 days to healthy living program is designed to help each other to identify how they can choose to use foods fuel for their bodies to optimize how they look and feel inside and out did you know breakfast is the most important meal of the day!?

what’s your favorite self love “activity”? hey there finally got some new headshots done by my amazing friend @ashleypaigephoto so i wanted to share and take a sec to introduce myself to my new followers. if you’re my friend or you’ve been following me for awhile you know what i’m about. for those who don’t, i’m a mama to 3 boys, wife to a firefighter, a professional photographer, a vegan, a consultant for amazing plant based health and wellness products, an autoimmune disease fighter, an avid reader and a lover of all things outdoors, but especially surfing, snowboarding, hiking, and spending time with my family. thanks for stopping by! i’d love to know more about you! getting back at it. prepping for my shoot with @photographybyalyssamichelle happy days i have never felt happier until i stopped comparing myself to others. you have to ask yourself: what does success mean to you: physically, mentally, emotionally, financially, or spiritually? what is it that you want in your own life? every soul on this earth is different. different in how we speak, how we act, what we desire, and so much more. it is so important to avoid the toxic mindset of comparison and focus on ourselves and our personal goals and visions. it is truly the greatest gift that you can give to yourself. so, why not start today? what is one thing that you can do today to love yourself? this is the ultimate healthy hair package if you need shine, growth and healthy locks, these vegan, botanical based, pea protein shampoo, conditioner and a collagen supplement are your go to this package is a game changer for hair that’s dry, loss of shine, had colour, over processed or wanting to grow dm for more info at least when i was shopping my eyes still looked pretty i adore the arbonne speak volumes mascara this @arbonne consultant didn’t even bother to add a medical disclaimer when encouraging her vulnerable new mommy audience to sign up as a pc. telling women to: 1. start a diet while pregnant or breastfeeding 2. feel guilty for feeling sluggish after growing and birthing a small human 3. feel like she’s not being a good enough mother and wife immediately after childbirth. 4. drop $266 on a diet during a pandemic. 5. sneak greens into their child’s food without seeking dr. approval 6. replace coffee 7. insinuate that adding probiotics will reduce anxiety and depression. this isn’t just an innocent consultant trying to make a side hustle. this is dangerous and reckless behavior. she should be ashamed to be guilting new mothers into feeling any kind of way in order to profit. evolution full control take 3x a day 30 mins before each meal mix with 250ml of water helps weight management program!

now more than ever, it is vital to be able to make money from the safety of your home! in my opinion, network marketing is the best way to start to build a second income stream to protect your family. you may be thinking, melani, i've tried that before. it doesn't work. i hear you! i used to think that too! however, after 18 years in the industry, i've discovered the 3 essential elements a network marketing business must have in order for you to earn that money and time freedom you've heard about. ready? you need... 1. 𝗔 𝗿𝗲𝗹𝗲𝘃𝗮𝗻𝘁 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁 -something people need and can only get from you! honestly, jewelry, shakes, essential oils and skincare are everywhere! you can get them from your local store too! 2. 𝗔 𝗥𝗼𝗮𝗱𝗺𝗮𝗽- making a list of 100 and harassing friends and family is not the way to build a business. having a duplicatable and proven step by step roadmap to earn money quickly and continuously is and if you were handed a social media system worth 10k just by purchasing the company's products so that you know what to do everyday to start earning....wouldn't that be huge? 3. 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗽 the rah rah and tough love that most receive from theri sponsor is not enough. sure! it's great for camaraderie! however, all the feel good recognition will do nothing for your bank account. real leaders pour into you with strategies and tactics and encourage you to get to your next rank with tried and true techniques without feeling icky and salesy. does your opportunity have all 3?

honestly my favs by far! hello friends, family and clients. after being inspired by @pineapplemamajae ive decided to become a independent consultant for arbonne. i had to try these products for myself before being able to promote for it. i did this 30 day cleanse hoping to feel better, i have auto immune disease and it tends to act up when im not keeping up on what im putting into my body which then can cause inflammation, pain and low energy. so i ordered the cleanse for my husband and i hoping to do a reset and get back to a healthy state. not only did i love it so did my husband. we both had such amazing results and now that i can give a honest review i decided to jump on board and become a consultant and share these amazing products with my already existing holistic healing business. i will not promote anything that has not helped my overall well being. these products are amazing, they not only have the 30 day cleanse, they have everything from nutrition, bath and body, skincare, make up and hair all made with clean ingredients, vegan and gluten free. im super excited to see where this all goes and who i can help. ill be sharing more on here and my instagram. my soul shine healer website link in bio now has an arbonne section if anybody would like to read up on these amazing products. dm me with any questions. thank you and have a blessed day!

2 reasons i was extremely busy running 4 jobs at the time one of them being trying to start my own business. i had no time to cook healthy meals, and the other reason being i received hurtful comments about how small i was so i tried to proove people wrong by eating junk and alot of it! this girl can eat i was also training 6 evenings a week and swimming afterwards so i believed that i would burn it off and gain muscle. how wrong was i all that happened was i was left exhaused, seeing no results and very unhealthy on the inside as soon as i got on the trial packnutrition plan my energy was through the roof in 2 days, i felt fresh i felt like i could get out of bed in the mornings, i was more productive in my days, i almost felt like i had more time as mad as that sounds i very quickly started to understand how to fuel my body and started doing this 5 -6 times a day with the right nutritonhydration levels. i then started to see results in the gym i dropped body fat!! shocked me didnt realise i had any to drop! but my lifestyle had taken its toll from years of rubbish! i also gained over half a stone of lean muscle, my hair, skin nails improved and i felt the strongest mentally and physically i had ever felt. i never looked back. from that day forward my life changed forever. i am fully emotional writing this post it scares me to think what my body would feel like if i continued how i was compared to how i feel now. how your body is deisgned to feel i now train 3 x a week and see the best results ever. thankyou herbalife you have totally transformed my life mind, body soul breakfast is served! lets get the day started! what did y'all have this morning for breakfast?

𝐌𝐚𝐬𝐤𝐜𝐚𝐫𝐚 𝐁𝐞𝐚𝐮𝐭𝐲 gave me that glow back and i wanted to share it. i’m very passionate about these products, i believe in them and love them, that’s what makes it so easy to share them! i absolutely love sharing my love for these products with others and seeing the glow it gives others! there is now more than just a new haircut or new hair color i can offer to women. i can now make them feel beautiful in their own skin. also, that’s not all! my team is the 𝐛𝐞𝐬𝐭 group of ladies. i’ve made so many new friends through this opportunity as an artist. the 𝐌𝐚𝐬𝐤𝐜𝐚𝐫𝐚 sisterhood is one like no other. so very thankful for everything 𝐌𝐚𝐬𝐤𝐜𝐚𝐫𝐚 𝐁𝐞𝐚𝐮𝐭𝐲 has brought to my life!! join me and the rest of the @thehacpack after a sleepy start. i am ready to go now with my metabolism boosting, energizing tea. cherry-pomegrante lemon tea!! what’s the minimum you can give on your workout?

do you sleep through the night or long enough?!? most likely the answer is no. so many things disrupt sleep patterns. you also may feel exhausted and not fall asleep. sleep is time to rebuild collagen and repair damage from uv exposure. the increase of blood flow reduces wrinkles and age spots. after a poor nights sleep, i cheat with the “the power of three” collection. while i like to get the right amount of sleep for health benefits, i also like to hide the fact i did not get 7-9 hours to renew and refresh. message me for a free consult and we can discuss what may help you hide the fact your sleep deprived. did you know... that as an artist you can host your own party to earn hostess credit?! you can! on top of earning weekly commission and monthly commission bonuses you can host your own party so you’ll never have to pay for makeup again except tax! each time you send a color match that isn’t tied to a customer party, send them your hostess link to order and your hostess credit adds up! it’s pretty awesome!! woke up in thinking about my last visit to cali. i went to with my @latinohive familia. i can’t wait to get back there. are you a wine drinker?

join my team.... link in bio....dm any questions if i were to explain my business to a 3-year-old, here's what i'd say: i teach people on the internet how to sell things so they can make money. do you think that covers it? what would yours be? setting the route to get us home. my favorite shampoo is on sale today! reposted from @ambitiousbabe.inc who is with me @ambitiousbabe.inc 365 days of being a maskcara beauty artist. a decision i made because i loved this makeup, was telling my friends family about it and honestly loved the idea of having $50 extra to put towards my student loans. i had no idea how much that decision of joining would positively impact my life. within the last year this business has brought out so much within myself that i didn’t know was there. i’ve met incredible women who quickly became some of my closest friends. i’ve learned that passion is the difference between having a job and having a career. i’ve learned that sometimes your life will be completely shaken up to relocate you to where you’re meant to be. i’ve been able to see beauty in everyday things. i’ve witnessed a community of uplifting women who believe in me even when i don’t believe in myself. i’ve learned to give myself grace. i’ve learned that growth is uncomfortable, but necessary. i’ve learned that magic happens when you do not give up, even though you want to. i’ve learned that you can create a life that you love, you just have to work for it. bring on another year of dreaming big working hard. i love baking and love trying out new recipes! woah! you're pastely today! that was emilia's reaction when she saw me this morning! since she was all in black today, i then mentioned to her the meme of i wear black when i workout, it's like a funeral for my fat, and her nonchalant response was i don't mourn my fat. and then i added, well, i like it, and it was free! now, let's get down to business! as you've probably heard weight training can slow the muscle loss that comes with aging, increase bone density, and boost the body's calorie-burning, but despite knowing this, most people still aren't doing it because either they don't know what do with weights or they just don't like them. however, even though i love weight training, the good news is that you don't have to use weights to strength train. you can get strong without lifting weights. how, you ask? well, sit-ups and push-ups and other exercises that use our body's weight as resistance. and that brings me to what i was thinking about this morning as i was doing what felt like endless squats, lunges, push-ups, core exercises, and more this morning, we were getting a total body cardio and resistance workout this morning, in 30-minutes and without any equipment! talk about efficiency! and challenging! which leads me to... getting a good start in the morning is the difference between having a good day and a bad day, but it isn’t as easy as it sounds. the key is to be intentional about how we start our day so that we can not only enjoy it but also be ready for whatever challenges come our way. whether we start the day with exercise or some other me time, we need to make sure to give ourselves some time to start the day right! nicole struggled with her self-confidence and not wanting to feel like she was “selling” something to her friends and family. and yet, she found incredible success and a blessing far beyond her expectations! what fears are holding you back? what objections do you have? i’m sure i felt them too. here’s my truth... never did i ever see myself in direct sales. i completely dismissed this industry as something beneath me or thought i’d be annoying and embarrass myself. but, i needed the skincare and i needed the money... so i took a leap of faith. i told myself that i would be coachable but that i would still only be myself. my sponsor assured me that if i stayed consistent, not only would my skin continue to get better, but i would build a business thst i’d be proud of. well, done done! this opportunity is so much more than just sharing great skincare. work it a little or a lot, either way... i’d love to show you how to get started! you can get started for only $75 and get a huge discount on your products, so what do you have to lose! simple little question... it has a million different answers. time. money. ability. fear. you know what the real answer usually is... you. you find all the excuses in the book and stop yourself before you even start, i’m speaking from experience. it’s hard to start something new, change is uncomfortable. it can be so incredibly worth it though!!! tell yourself to and see what happens! what’s stopping you? what’s up everybody! i know a lot of you are aware of the questions i asked on my story this week about red flags. join me tonight 5pm pacific, 8pm est to discuss these results and introduce myself on @manmeetsmodern embrace the struggle. always be genuine. remain humble, yet hungry. set clear goals. never give up. growth is a process, not a destination. keep learning 'til your head explodes. drop down some non scale victories and i would love to see your before and after pics!!! these 2 help you see changes that the can't tell you and it helps everyone else have more hope to continue on!!! thank you in advance! let's share all our wins to make friday fantastic!!! who’s looking for an e-girl waifu?! strawberries and cream no need to say more. looking into the future. as i stare into the explosion of orange and yellow that lies before me, a new day has dawned. i’m walking with so much more confidence than ever before. not a cocky confidence, but the quiet type. i know what direction i want to go in life. won’t you join me on my journey? my mission is to inspire the world through my story, my adventures and my passion. learning how to walk in confidence is a huge part of how i’ve become who i am. it’s friday, the weekend is here. enjoy it! live fearless my friends. let’s conquer this life, together. who else ’s coffee as much as me? if i had a dollar for every time someone started a direct sales business and told themselves bullshit stories before they even really tried, i’d have another solid stream of income but for real, ladies...why do we do this?! before we give it our best shot, we spend more time telling ourselves things like i’m going to bother people everyone’s going to judge me⁣ no one will want to buy my product i’m not successful enough i’m not pretty enough my audience isn’t big enough i’ve failed before, so i’ll fail again here’s what i’m asking you to do: if you’re going to spend energy on that internal dialogue, you must give equal time and energy to stories like:⁣ i have something of value to offer⁣ i am attracting all the right people of course i’ll succeed⁣ i’m going to help people people are going to see me succeed i deserve this i’m worthy because what we focus on is what comes to fruition. so give yourself a damn shot, girlfriend. you’ve got this. tag share with your teams and sideline sisters who need to hear this happy friday!!!! i hope you are as excited about the weekend as i am!! hope you have an amazingly awesome day!!! it’s official once she puts up the listing i will share on here please pray that this house goes fast so then we can start looking for our home over near pfizer where my wife works thank you i love decorating old sleds!! which one do you like best?

the answer: false! i was surprised, too! researchers have found that the more people ran, the less likely they were to develop knee problems! so in fact, may actually help your joints rather than hurt them. if you do happen to feel knee pain, it’s probably due to overtraining or poor form. what i am loving about this running program i am doing is the trainer! she is so sweet and supportive and i am learning so much about running. like, who knew there was so much to it?! not me! overall, i've been feeling fairly good and am accomplishing more with each workout. my knees haven't really been bothering me, but my calves and shins have been super tight! we have some amazing stretching workouts...and i've been using them all! so, let me know what you do to keep your calves and shins from tightening up! also, if you'd like to learn more about this running program i am doing, my inbox is open! i'm currently getting clients set up for my november wellness group! perfect time to join us! dm me for more details! i love what i do and want to share it with the world! join my team! join my vip page in facebook! join the fun!! www.facebook.comgroupsblingwithaubrey you can choose what you see. are things happening to you, or for you?

most people will say consistency!! am i right? that is for sure the thing that i have when it comes to getting my workouts in!! if we stopped making things that aren’t a priority, a priority, and starting making things that should be a priority, a priority, our lives would be a so much different! can i get an amen? make yourself a priority.... stop making excuses... show up everyday for yourself consistency is key yes, it takes time and massive consistency to build your body or lose the weight! stay patient, stay consistent and keep yourself a priority.... it will happen!! fear is a funny thing... the word fear-less is even funnier. in a great book i’ve finally began reading... it said we should focus not on being fearless but on beating fearfully. having fear is healthy. having fear to the point of stagnancy is not. so instead... acknowledge your fear, become acquainted with them pull it right alongside you for your ride. and then watch it slowly take a back seat once you’ve pushed through giving you the confidence to keep pushing the envelope to your fears and opening up opportunities that wouldn’t be noticed otherwise. “be the woman who fixes another woman crown without telling the world it was crooked” i do not post group pictures as i should!! this one is just perfect!! blessed for all the struggles i’ve been going to finally be able to be surrounded of strong and amazing girls and moms every days!! we all work on our goals and becoming the best version of ourselves 1 each day!! and you can join us too!!! dm today so excited for tonight! zoom training with this one, the legend, frazer brookes $7 to join the business promo ends tomorrow so get in asap ask me how to join my team send me a dm hello from cali! so excited to be back on the west coast. even more pumped to make my return interviewing the beautiful woman that is @aminabuddafly on the make sure to tune in today at 7pm est4pm pst. see ya’ll on my ig live then this woman right here has done so much for my life and helped me repair myself inside and out. she messaged me when i was at one of my darkest moments of doubt within myself and pulled me out! i am so blessed god put her in my life at that moment. i would give her excuse after excuse and she didn’t sugar coat anything, and was like, “girl i can pour into you everyday-all day, but it’s never going fill your cup until you start filling that cup.” y’all that has stuck with me since that day and it woke me up! i know it seems like a duh moment, but it’s just what i needed and was just that simple. from that day forward she has been my glue, my person to lean on, to run to when i have questions, and this relationship would have never existed if it weren’t for us wanting more for not just our own lives, but for other women as well. so if not now sis, then when? yes i know you work full time or part time, you have school, you have kiddos running wild, and life just is out of control, etc.. but i’m here to tell you there will never be a time in your life where there’s not shit going on or that life slows down for you to achieve them goals! sis, you have to take control of your life, make the damn time, and make your life what you want it to be cause no one can do that for you. so are you ready?

tell me all about it when it’s still 90 degrees out so you find fall where you can i have never felt so confident in my skin! it looks amazing and i don’t even feel like i need foundation most days. you are the queen of your business! here’s what’s awesome about being a makscara artist...no one is bugging you to sell more, do more, start a team, or do all the things for them to get ahead. and that completely changes how you do business. you can dabble or commit. you can build a team or not. you can be an elite hac-er or top influencer. you can sell $14 or $14,000 a month. you can use social media channels or just focus on in-person color matching. there are so many choices or options for how you run your business and each one is yours, not someone else’s. you do you and you will be successful! what are you waiting for? him- “babe!” me-“what?!” him- “pick up all of your lashes....they look like black asps everywhere!” me-“welll...boooooooo” this is us, we are the power couple that fights with our hustle everyday..... where is your hustle taking you? i’d tell you mine but i move in secret.....just wait for my success when i arrive. my asps are helping me reach my dreams. thanks to leadership for my shirt. y’all are starting a lash short wardrobe. go ahead and ask- what lashes am i wearing how do you get started answer these- where do you want to go are you a hustler i love these and love that they are 3sp for 10 of them. thanks @pretzelcrisps for making a great w.w. snack. who usually wins in your internal mind game? i was on the struggle bus this morning... first, it was the internal mind-game of whether i should get up at 6:00 am to workout or tell emilia we would try to fit it in after school as if.... i was going back and forth in my head, for about 60-seconds some of you may know, 60-seconds can feel like a long time!, and discipline won. it took me a little longer to get ready but by 6:15 am i was in our home gym, and emilia was sitting there, waiting for me. then it was whether i should do the entire workout low-impact or full-out. low-impact won, and that's fine, because this workout is hard, not cardio hard, but push-up hard! like, really hard. and that's pretty much how it works! some days, we're 100 into our workouts and totally motivated, and other days, we just push through until it's over. but you want to know something, those are the days we should be most proud of! the days when we don't want to do it, when we have to dig deep to get through it, those are the days when we prove to ourselves that we can do hard things and we should be proud of our accomplishments. by the way, this applies to everything in life... are you ready for a change? want to redefine your life? let's do it together. i’ll be here, right along with you, cheering you on! happy thursday friends trick or treat???? guess what i have!!! who needs bats, cats, moons, and pumpkin nails???? yesssss!!! i just found a color street stash and have them ready to sell!!! who will be the first to claim!!!! comment below! very recently i picked up the courage to move to a big city. usually, i hate it in rowdy, boisterous places being an introvert and all. so you can imagine how very difficult and challenging it was for me to make the decision to move out of my previous location. put in mind that my previous location was also my parents' house. it has been almost two months since i moved and i just want everyone to know that i have been handling the big city life like a pro. i truly wear the hat right. i have come to enjoy the stress associated with it. been able to understand the mean people. and somehow got used to the awful smell. i have also found a new love with the nightlife, met some really awesome people. appreciated the fact that you could just be nice or smile with people and not be their friends. i still don't like the hubbub, but i am definitely going to have more tales from the big city and share the life as i see it. poured myself a cup of my magic coffee! it’s a cup of ambition for sure...and so much more! i am strong i am successful you are strong your are successful you are beautiful you are worthy you are needed you can change the world you can make a difference in your life and the life of someone else! how are you going to do that??

the answer is simple i control my attitude and my mindset. do i have bad moments... yes. i'm human! i do not let those moments determine the outcome of my entire day. i do not let things get in the way of my happiness. the only difference between a good day and a bad day is your attitude. the choice is always yours. -dennis brown link in bio.. lets chat about your goals and how i may be able to help you great morning my beautiful healthy familia we are still continuing our pumpkin exercises we also spoke a bit about we yearn to have love in our lives, however if we don’t have love to give how can we attract it?

never disappoints when you really want nachos but are eating healthy you make nachos with cauliflower instead of chips! so yummy!! take note. this is on the move in only two weeks, my personal red aspen team maintained our rank. and only a week later we hit the next rank. what?!?! hitting red aspen’s brand manager rank was my big goal for this month. it’s what i wanted for myself and for my team. it’s what the five of us have been working for. it’s what i’ve been manifesting each and every day. and it’s here this notebook i’m holding is my personal red aspen notebook. it’s everything i’ve learned over the past 5 months from my corporate team sparkle roots, from my upline leaders, from my side hustle sisters, and things i’ve found along the way that work best for me. you can do this, too. if i can do this while working a 40-hourweek job, raising a toddler, strengthening my marriage, making time for god, and everything else that comes up throughout each day so can you! i believe in you. dm me, i’d love to chat more with you about my journey! did ya know? while only 52 of american households earn more than $50k a year, that number goes up to 58 for individuals involved in direct selling companies. so, yeah, let’s stop the whole “mlms prey on the financially vulnerable” dialogue, mmmkay? source: direct selling association, dsa national salesforce study based on the us census ok, time for a full transparency post. this year has been hard, yes, for lots of reasons. this summer, amidst the busyness of unpacking, getting our house ready for sale, repacking, and taking lots of trips out of town, i didn’t make very good choices when it came to my health. the result? over 10 lbs gained. cue: “what?! but aren’t you a health coach?! don’t you eat healthy?” answer: yes yes. but here’s the thing. losing weight doesn’t mean it will magically stay off. i don’t take “skinny” pills or supplements to keep weight off. i don’t sell a diet. my program is a lifestyle change. it’s a habit reformer. it also requires consistency. i spent nearly 37 years creating bad habits in my life. i spent nearly a year working on correcting them. it took about 2 months of me choosing not to live up to my healthy potential. there have been too many decisions for lattes, fast food, cocktails, and dessert. sure, i had healthy things in between. but being “healthy” “most of the time” isn’t enough. just because you eat an extra few salads doesn’t mean you can eat an extra few slices of cake. so i’m back at it. i’m here to say i’m not perfect. i’m going back to the weight loss portion of my program to finally drop these lbs. i had excuses for days. no more. i’m telling my own coaches to keep me accountable. and now here’s your part. will you join me? either for added accountability, or jumping in getting healthy with me. if you want to know more about how this all works, pm me. let’s do it together. got our nightly walk in! who is like me and is just looking for that low point dessert this is 4sp, you can use any sugar free cake mix, im guessing chocolate would be amazing but i only had yellow so i worked with it. 1 box of sugar free cake mix, 1 can 15 oz of pumpkin 0sp, 1 c water and i used pumpkin spice 0sp seasoning didn't measure it just added to taste. 14 cup per cupcake holder per cake mix 14c is a serving 4sp. baked on 350 for 20 min. added ff chocolate whipped topping 0 sp for extra taste 4sp total. you can add sugar free chocolate chips or whatever you like. @pillsburybaking you can sit with women who gossip about other women's goals, or you can sit with women who strategize with you and encourage you to achieve yours. choose wisely. ejercicio es como decirle a tu cuerpo “me odiarás por esto, pero lo agradecerás después.” exercise it's like saying to your body you will hate me for this, but you will appreciate it later. every day i wake up and share this gift with the world around me! helping others take control of their health and changing lives is my biggest gratification. i’ve seen first hand how valuable our health is. you realize in a hurry $6 a day is nothing compared to watching your son doing $2000 injections every two weeks for his medical condition!

many of us struggle to maintain weight loss, and we commit to it for health reasons me! but, if you're a dancer, like emilia, and you're expected to not only look a certain way but also to always perform at your peak, there's even more pressure. fad-diets and intense boot camps can help us drop a few pounds, but keeping it off is a challenge. and studies have shown that 95 of dieters gain the lost weight within 1 to 5 years. we don’t want our dancers to resort to extreme measures that will do them more harm than good think eating disorders. we need to focus on a lifestyle change for better health, not a diet. diets are always restrictive, with an all-or-nothing approach. a lifestyle change needs to be based on our life and what works for us. strategy: eat vegetables with every meal. it seems insignificant, but the benefits happen over time and everyone's eating healthier! the american college of sports medicine recommends at least 250 minutes of moderate-intensity activity a week to maintain weight loss. it seems like a lot, especially when a dancer puts so many hours into dance, but it doesn’t have to be extreme. jogging, fast walking and other moderate-intensity activities can help. and resistance training helps build and preserve muscle mass. benefit: the more muscle we have, the more calories we burn during the day, even at rest. it’s normal to “fall off the wagon,” and we can learn and grow from these moments. we can use it as an opportunity to learn more about ourselves and our needs. because weight loss is not just about weight—it’s about being healthier, more energetic, and feeling better about oneself. however, once we reach our goals, it’s easy to fall back into bad habits. remember your “why”: to have more energy, endurance, to be stronger, and to perform at your best. there’s no magic pill; it all comes down to making better eating choices, scheduling daily exercise and, remembering our why: to be the healthiest we can be! remember, you don't have to do it alone! let's connect! comment below or message me! i'm here to help! so our nfl warmer pre-sale did so well scentsy is opening them to grab again!!!! these will be available on oct 26th!

so little know fact about me: i love stripes but don’t really buy them for myself because i never liked the way they looked. well i actually like the way they look now!! changing my mindset and getting healthier can change so much!! okay, i did it for you. active income comes as a direct result of our efforts. it’s what i frequently refer to as “trading hours for dollars.” there are ways to make stellar and significant active income becoming a ceo, doctor, play professional sports, etc but the thing about active income is that you always have to show up in order to get paid. residual income refers to the money you continue to make after your work is done. in direct sales, a consultant may work to earn the business of customer a, but the consultant will continue to get paid every time customer a makes a future purchase. the myth about residual income is that you can then just kick back and never work ever again. not true. but it does allow you the freedom and flexibility to continue to build and live life on your terms in the meantime you guys, i’m so spoiled. a fellow posh leader whose gift is clearly building people up has been so encouraging to me!

swipe right to see some books i checked out recently. i particularly love investigating symbols and the meaning people give to symbols in art. i wonder why artists chose a particular color and shape and the meaning they tried to convey. it stirs the creative part of me inside. what people, books or hobbies do you love that inspire you creatively? comment so we can swap all resources!

thankful for my health! in moments of hard times, the only thing i can control is my health! i am shooting for 20 pounds by thanksgiving! join me! who is up for the challenge?? how much do you want to lose in six weeks? i'm trying to be summer fine in the fall time it doesn’t matter where you are in your journey, everyone is a beginner in something. if you are just starting out on your fitness journey, it’s ok to feel uncertain and uncomfortable. that’s a part of the process. everyone starts where you are. embrace that feeling. use it as motivation to learn and progress instead of allowing it to hinder you. if you are already a few stages into your fitness journey, you may feel like you have it figured out. guess what, you don’t. i don’t either. there is always more to learn and new boundaries to push. learn a new skillset. set new goals. and do it from the mind of a beginner, searching for new knowledge and accomplishing new achievements. learn from someone who does it better than you. or maybe you are getting frustrated because you’ve plateaued and don’t understand why what you’ve been doing to get to this point doesn’t work anymore. it’s time to change things up. switch up your routine. try something different. focus on something else that still accomplishes your long term goals of becoming the best version of yourself. reach out to someone who knows more who can help offer guidance. becoming the best version of yourself means being better today than yesterday. every day is another opportunity to be better and do better. let’s goooo!

exactly two years ago today i came home from living out in manitoba it only took me a few weeks to decide my hair was dead and that i wanted to chop it all off so i did! i chopped it off to my neck from my butt and called it a day over the past year and a half that i wasn’t using monat my length only got down to shoulders and was still as dry and brittle as the day i cut it all off my thought process; i could have spared the chop and insecurity issues and kept my dead hair if that’s what was going to continue to happen anyway. but then i was i introduced to monat and 6 months later, my hair almost to my mid back, it’s so healthy, so hydrated it feels luxurious tip of the week! happy sunday .⠀wake up .⠀pray up glow up took today to just meditate and relax got our morning walk in! i got the go ahead to start working out as soon as 4 weeks pp. i am so unbelievably excited but know that i unfortunately need to address a few things about this, so people understand and maybe, just maybe, are less judgmental. 1 i’m so happy and proud of my body and what it accomplished these last 9-10 months. i’m not itching to get back because i “need” my body back. i’m not concerned about losing weight, i workout for so many other reasons. 2 off of that, i workout and have always worked out because it helps me significantly from a mental standpoint. i don’t always love the workout, but i absolutely love how i feel after. 3 having my postpartum journey kick off right as we head in to the winter months, makes me that much more appreciative of the ability to workout from home. i can’t lie, the fear of ppd creeping in been pretty solid so far during the darkest months of the year, has me that much more motivated to get back into a routine with my fitness. 4 jayden will always be my reason and not my excuse. this isn’t a call out to those that don’t make this a priority. this isn’t a jab to those that don’t care. this is what matters to me. 5 you bet your ass i’ll be going for it day 1, but i’ll also be listening to my body and taking it easymodifying when necessary. i’m kicking off my next program on november 2nd. i’m still debating between 2-3 programs that i’m itching to complete, but will for sure be kicking off my over 2 month hiatus on the 2nd. are you interested in joining me in 2 weeks? drop a comment below or pm me. i’m always looking to add more like minded people to my team and am here to helpmotivate you through your goals. comment below or pm me for more info!

if some people make a shit ton of money and a lotta people make a big fat goose egg, guess what? there are still thousands of people in the middle who are making a life changing income. “life changing” doesn’t mean “millionaire-quit-your-full time-job-and-buy-five-yachts” status. maybe that means they can now afford their kids’ dance lessons.⁣ maybe it means they can cover their car payment without taking from their main paycheck. maybe it means they can go part time at the salon now. maybe it means they have a safety net for the ebb and flow of their family business. maybe it means they’re having more fun.⁣ maybe it means they’re overcoming their anxiety by doing something outside of their comfort zone. so yeah, i see your income disclosure statement argument which, btw, is there to make sure no one feels like false promises are made but take a better look at the people in the middle. we’re changing our lives whether you want to believe it or not. why thank you! i feel good too! what if i told you that 10 years from now your life would be exactly the same?

this is exactly why! since 2015 i’ve been a product of the product. it hasn’t only giving me the results that i’ve always wanted but, all while being able to look and feel good inside and out. but most importantly my health. being a women with hypothyroidism and rheumatoid arthritis things get pretty complicated with staying healthy if you allow it to consume you. it’s changed my life is ways more then one and being able to remain in good nutrition especially now with my little man i’m forever grateful with this amazing company. and even so more with the people that coached me and guided me in the right direction. your support and surroundings will always play a huge part of your journey! i still got a ways to go to get where i want but i will get there! if this year has taught us anything, it’s that no one is immune to having the rug pulled out from under them. residual income doesn’t need to be your main income, but if it’s not in your financial portfolio, you’re making a mistake. residual income pays you after the initial work has been done. no, it’s not a magic bullet or a seed that plants money trees, and yes, it requires work, but it’s a financial decision that, with little upfront investment and unmatched flexibility to make it work should be a top priority for everyone. a great place to start?

do you think money is “bad” or that to want i⁣⁣t makes you “greedy”?⁣ or do you believe that money is simply energy and to have more of it makes you a more impactful human? the fact of the matter is this: direct sales is unlike any other opportunity out there; the startup cost is low and the income and freedom potential is truly limitless. but here’s the thing: most people don’t genuinely believe that that type of wealth and abundance exists andor is available to them. attracting wealth and success starts first in your mind. if you go in to an experience thinking it’s shit and that you’ll fail and everyone will think you’re an idiot...guess what?⁣⁣ you’ll fail and everyone will think you’re an idiot. but what if you went into an opportunity with the acceptance that yeah, maybe you feel nervous and unsure, but you believe that you are worthy to receive all the wealth and abundance that’s already out there?⁣⁣ well then, yeah, that shit is comin’ to ya. bom bom bi dom bum bay⁣ check me out!!!! not only do i look amazing coz let’s face it yes i do but i am feeling amazing too!!!! these pics are 6 weeks apart best thing i ever did was take some time for myself... if i can do it so can you!!! my inbox is always open if you want any info on how you can get your journey started, i am more than happy to help you achieve whatever goal it is you have maskcara 5 checks a month today is bonus day!⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ tori belle 3 checks a month⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ contract work 1 check a month each gracegritandlipstick.com shop paid with every sale⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ i do not have a normal 9 to 5. our kids aren't in daycare. we have paid off student loans. we have paid off all our debt twice. we bought a house with mortgage payments lower than our rent. we don't have cable. we have a strict budget. we only buy used cars. we really @mrcru2 fix or build on our own if we can before we hire the job out. we are not normal by america's standard. most american families have 2 working parents with just 2 incomes and tens of thousands of dollars in debt. we have worked very hard to not be normal, and i am more than okay with that. if you're sick of normal, let's talk i love helping other women come up with new ideas on how to make their money work for their life. leave an emoji in the comments of one of your goals and i'll send you a message.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ i’ve been so ill the last few days i allowed myself to run out of my magic beans that won’t be happening again!!! i’m currently doubling up to help myself get to full health again, and i just went straight to bed after work the last few days....no resting today; saturday’s are a busy day for us! papa is working so it’s just me and the kids! i’ve flooded my body with fruit and vegetables in the form of my capsules and my shake, ready to play taxi for the day! first run of dance is done....she is happy that most certainly helps she’s rocking her new dance boots my first purchase with my juicy wages, obviously goes on my kids 𝙱𝚎 𝚝𝚑𝚎 𝚎𝚗𝚎𝚛𝚐𝚢 𝚢𝚘𝚞 𝚠𝚊𝚗𝚝 𝚝𝚘 𝚊𝚝𝚝𝚛𝚊𝚌𝚝 manifest those goals! best practices more to grow on instagram- you are sure to take something away from the special thanks to my tribe from @pandemicteevee for the love support! tomorrow at 3pm! in association with @spark.liveapp book now- link in bio! you my friend shall go to the ball discipline is all you need to be successful in any field or in any sector. follow @hindgauravkushwaha hashtags no todas las mujeres estamos hechas de azúcar, algunas estamos hechas de cerebro, vino, aventura y sin miedo! not all women are made of sugar, some of us are made of brain, wine, adventure and fearless! “lean toward love...” simple products high ingredients rejuv spray: superfood for the skin. infinity oil: 100 emu oil link in bio, shop under beauty and hygiene. 6 reasons why you should join farmasi farmasi's compensation plan is the most aggressive in america. we are the highest paying company! and this is why we are the fastest growing company! our products and the fact that we make everything in our own factory! our products are being manufactured in one single plant where our president.checks every product one by one. if there is a problem with our units, we don't continue with them. no sacrificing quality!! we have good quality with affordable prices. service quality...shipping times-processing in less then 24 hours. answering customer calls within minutes and support tickets being answered within 24 hours. family owned and family managed! why are we doing so well?

perfect beach hey y'all! let me drop some facts and tea on y'all today. save this post. share it too. black women are leading the charge in entrepreneurship. we own more than 2 million businesses, and woc are 4.5 times more likely to start a business than other groups. on paper, this sounds amazing, right? however... black women get approved for about 2 of the credit and financing they apply for. that is a problem because we are starting businesses but we hit a wall when it comes to growth, expansion, and staying open. what if we could change the narrative around this topic? because we can. we can access millions if not billions of dollars of funding, if we know how. access to more funding can help you: invest in hiring staff. invest in business tools to help you scale. hire that strategist, consultant or coach you need. free up more cash flow my friend jeri is the credit goddess. she helps people every single day by teaching folks how to build personal and business credit including me! to learn more about jeri and how she can help you, click the 4th button in the link in my bio. we got to sleep in! ok, it was only 30 extra minutes but that's better than nothing! remember, we don't wake up early because we want to, we do it because it's the only time we have! emilia has dance almost every day after school so working out together in the afternoon is practically impossible.⠀ however, i'm not going to tell you that you should exercise in the morning because the best time to exercise is when we can do it consistently. we are all different and it all depends on our preference and lifestyle.⠀ however, if you are considering exercising in the morning, these are a few benefits to ponder: 1. usually, with morning workouts there are fewer distractions because we haven’t started working on our to-do list or our workout is the first thing on our list! 2. a morning workout often sets the tone for a healthier day. exercise can inspire us to eat healthier and to make healthier choices throughout the day.⠀ 3. regular exercise boosts energy and reduces fatigue, so we'll feel more energized throughout the day.⠀ 4. exercise improves focus and concentration, regardless of when you do it, but a 2019 study published in the british journal of sports medicine found that morning exercise improves attention, visual learning, and decision-making.⠀ 5. since exercise is a natural remedy for stress gotta love those endorphins, working out in the morning starts your day on a positive note. for emilia and me, working out in the morning is better because we get it done before the day’s responsibilities get in the way. however, that’s not to say that working out in the evening doesn't have its own benefits, like:⠀ our body temperature is highest at around 4 to 5 p.m so our muscles are already warmed up.⠀ after a long day, exercise can be a great way to unwind and de-stress.⠀ our strength and endurance are higher in the afternoon.⠀ however, it’s always best to exercise at the time of day that works best for you because consistent exercise at any time of day is better than inconsistent morning workouts!⠀ remember, there isn’t a right time to exercise, but the best time is the one that we can stick to for life! breaking a sweat, pushing everyday staying consistent. even if it’s at a slower pace. thinking about it is making you $0, and that sucks. we're happy because it's payday! ha! but seriously, it's only been a few weeks since i saw these ladies in the mountains and i am so missing each one of them. even though they're only a tiny portion of our team, it was so cool to sit in a room with all of them and realize that each one of them represents a different season in my life, and that @maskcarabeauty has brought us all together in the room where it happens. ahem, thank you hamilton. we have completely different backgrounds, different perspectives, and totally different lives but we are a team and we have an open seat for you at the table. so if you want more than just money, if you want a sisterhood that supports, let us know. girl, we got your back.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ photo cred: @kellywhitmorephoto⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ @babygotblush @thirdquarterbeauty @ranchersglow i want it all there i said it. and i don’t feel bad for it. i want to not have to look at price tags when i shop. i want to never have to pay for gas in change again. i want to be able to travel wheneverwherever i want. i want to pay off all my debt. i want to be in charge of my own schedule. i want to look and feel good in my own skin and clothes. i want to be the best and most present mom and partner i can be. i want it all. and i know that coaching will get me there. someone told me a while back to set more “attainable” goals. ummm who says i can’t attain whatever i set my mind to?!?

we all need a little adventure every once in a while! to add a little zest to our lives, it's important to try new and, dare i say it, sometimes even scary things!⠀ the same goes for our health and fitness. say walking is our thing, but after 6 months, we're not seeing any changes, our results have plateaued, and we're getting a little bored and discouraged but are unsure of where to go from here. we need some fresh ideas to keep our fitness goals interesting and gain results. what's the answer: we need to get out of your comfort zone! 1. try something new, if walking is your thing, up the intensity, add intervals, and strength training. 2. keep track of your fitness in a training log that will help you get a clearer picture of your progress⠀ 3. sign-up for a race, even if it's virtual. want to join us in a 5k? let's talk!⠀ 4. a change in our routine does not have to be drastic or scary, but it does need to be a bit of a challenge! by the way, the same is true in life. what is most difficult and challenging is usually what is most worthwhile, but it’s easier to put it off and stay in our comfort zone. by pushing ourselves to do what we’ve been too scared to start we'll not only challenge ourselves, we'll feel more accomplished, even if we don't succeed. bottom line: the secret to moving out of our comfort zone and improving our health and fitness is to start now! to get a little uncomfortable. don’t think, just commit to something new, different, and yes, maybe even a little scary!⠀ i bet you’ll be amazed at what you can achieve! ain’t these the best looking kids you’ve ever seen.... i mean!!!! my favorite duo to serve! ahhhh so happy you guys came to visit me today! can’t thank u both enough for the continuous support! smash that lift off mrs. beadie!!! lol... omg we have having too much fun with this one. thank u so much for coming by! today i woke up like this, stood in front of the mirror had the biggest smile from ear to ear no i didn’t wake up with abs, no i don’t have the perfect body, no i’m not at my goal yet, yes i’m still working on me, yes i still get distracted, yes i still have my days where i want to give up it’s not about perfection, it’s about progress you want to know what i do have though confidence self love happiness joy gratitude i can go on but ya’ll get my drift i learned to love myself again for me starting my journey wasn’t to have the “perfect body” cause we are all different there’s really no real definition of a “perfect body” it was to create a healthier happier lifestyle for me everyone around me choice is yours if you wanna start earning in a very short period of time, dm me now! start your journey today! just 1 to 2 hours a day and earn 2k daily dm me for guidance 8 months ago i needed help with energy. i woke up tired and went to bed tired. i was moody, full of aches and discomfort and i had no focus or motivation now i wake up happy for the day, well rested, full of energy and ready to take on the day!! these three little capsules have changed my life!!! i absolutely 𝐖𝐎𝐔𝐋𝐃 𝐍𝐎𝐓 have made the switch if it wasn’t worth it...and i’m telling you it 𝐃𝐄𝐅𝐈𝐍𝐈𝐓𝐄𝐋𝐘 𝐈𝐒!!! there is no downside to a side hustle. there are only benefits to building more than one source of income. a side hustle is the new job security. forbes your time is now! what’s holding you back?

i never thought i would be excited for a running program i mean getting some new workout gear does make it a little more awesome though i have always dreaded running because i always told myself that i can’t run. that’s stemming back to all the bad memories i’ve had in school when we had to run. i was always embarrassed and hated when we had to run because i was always last. i ended up walking most of the time while everyone ran right past me. then flash forward to my 20’s when i decided i wanted to be a police officer that quickly changed when i became pregnant shortly after starting to pursue it. i remember having to go through testing and run. when i got on that track i froze and panicked. i knew i was going to be slow and last. at one point, russ even came on the track and ran with me just to help me finish. i’ve always envied people that could run, and told myself that i could never do what they do. but i’m tired of telling myself that i can’t do things! i’m tired of letting excuses stop me!! so i am stepping waaaaayyyyy out of my comfort zone these next 30 days and doing something i told myself that i can’t. see that’s the thing, i told myself i can’t. i put that thought in my head, and i had myself believing that. you know though, i have the power to chanfe it!!! and that’s exactly what i’m doing i’m taking on the challenge to prove to myself that i can do anything i put my mind to! i’m 3 days in and loving this journey so far i can’t wait to see what the rest brings!! i’d love for you to join me! let’s get out of our comfort zones and take on this challenge together checking out my competition! look in the mirror, yep! there you go little visit from the ‘pump fairy’ no grunting involved everything is better with a fresh set mani of color street! watch how you can go from coral bay summertime to coral bay fall just by adding plaid about you! get your nails fall ready today!!!! use the link to order!!!! https:www.colorstreet.comdivanaildynastyparty1744936 fun at the club this morning! mrs. waters smashing her lift off for her favorite mega tea!! there’s no better time than now to smile. i know i know...2020. but i’m choosing to be grateful for what i have and what i’m accomplishing despite the punches 2020 is throwing my direction. the new limited edition palette i'm also wearing the brown ink liner that lasts all day no flaking and also the new double effect mascara only one coat so many new products no filter ever needed with farmasi ....total win!!!! shinewithstacey.com to order yours!! working towards my happiness and well-being was a lot easier than staying miserable and unhappy with myself. the best thing i ever did was invest the time and money on me. instead of spending the money on something not valuable... i made myself valuable instead click the link in my bio what have you got to lose?

the fact of the matter is this: direct sales is unlike any other opportunity out there; the startup cost is low and the income and freedom potential is truly limitless. but here’s the thing: most people don’t genuinely believe that that type of wealth and abundance exists andor is available to them. attracting wealth and success starts first in your mind. if you go in to an experience thinking it’s shit and that you’ll fail and everyone will think you’re an idiot...guess what?⁣⁣ you’ll fail and everyone will think you’re an idiot. but what if you went into an opportunity with the acceptance that yeah, maybe you feel nervous and unsure, but you believe that you are worthy to receive all the wealth and abundance that’s already out there?⁣⁣ well then, yeah, that shit is comin’ to ya. bom bom bi dom bum bay⁣ what a awesome maskcara has taken me on so over the past 7 months!!! i have bonded with the most amazing ladies all over the country, been to vegas, arizona and utah. i’m going to sc in november and san diego in sept 2021. not only have i made such great friends but i have also boosted my income. which makes my husband happy. so that’s a right! if you would like to learn more about maskcara artist program let’s chat!!! bring back my buddy is coming! monday october 12th for limited time only! love our skincare?

your not alone gut-brain dysfunction may be to blame... the gut and the brain have a special connection... unfortunately, aspects of modern life such as high stress, diets high in processed food, antibiotics, pesticides, and sanitized, urban environments have decreased both the amount and richness of healthy gut microbiota, while increasing the amount of unhealthy microorganisms. the latest theories of depression suggest that gut microbiota imbalance could play a major role in this disorder. research shows that gut microbiota play a vital role in immunity, hormonal balance, and nervous system functioning. gut microbiota also play a role in immune system functioning and regulate the production of chemical messengers... to the brain gut bacteria manufacture about 95 percent of the body's supply of serotonin, which influences both mood and gi activity... the use of prebiotics and probiotics together is called microbiome therapy. you don't need to take a prebiotic for probiotics to work, but taking them might make your probiotics more effective are you taking care of your gut health new release wednesday, never fails! i am in love the luxe camo in black and gray swipe to see all the new releases! order through the link in my bio or send me a message @zyia.with.court people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do it 2021, i’m coming for you different. these last 3 months are gonna be no joke. the universe has been almost scary aligned for me and i’m not letting it go over my head. watch or do. the choice is yours. don’t get left behind. don’t regret not taking action now how are you spending the 4th quarter of this year?

never in my life did i think i would ever be small enough to share clothes with my girls. growing up i was always petite then life hit me with stress, anxiety, ocd, insomnia, pregnancy, gi issues, aches and pains, inflammation, etc and i packed on the pounds over 19 years. well this happened on saturday when i was in wisconsin for a team conference!!! that is kylee in my shirt!!! never accept negativity keep your head on straight and prove to the haters you are better than they think you are. your heart is pure and he will see that singapore what is your why?⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ you might be starting your business to create your financial independence, make an impact, make friends, be your own boss, work whenever you want, work from anywhere. there are multiple reasons. but sometimes we lose track of why we started and we get carried away with all that's happening in our business.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ we are too busy to remember that we started to take more time to be with our close ones. we are too busy to remember to take time for ourselves.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ your biz is thriving. that is amazing.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ but without you, the ceo, it won't for long.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ remember your why, why you've started, and focused on implementing that into your routine. did you want to spend more time with your kids? so, do it. having a business takes time and lots of responsibility, but because there is no one telling you to take a break, it doesn't mean you shouldn't. what did you picture your life to be when you first started? remember that picture and keep creating this.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ there will always be things you can work on, but there is also tomorrow. how does this go for you so far?⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ two of my favorite ladies!!! weight loss... weight gain... in the end we all need nutrition. these two ladies, connie and tricia inspire me something fierce. connie has lost almost 100 pounds and tricia has gained lean muscle back. they look so beautiful, strong and healthy. both of their stories started off with different goals. the beauty of their stories is they both needed nutrition. it’s so simple... i am beyond proud and happy for these two! some mornings we're just not feeling it like today! but, with a combination of discipline we're already up anyways and our powerful pre-workout, we got it done! however, emilia and i both decided to follow the modifier during the entire workout and do it low-impact not to be confused with easy there are many benefits to low impact cardio, but these are just a few!⠀ 1. low impact exercise can minimize the stress placed on the knees, hips, ankles, and back. 2. low impact exercises can be sufficient for improving aerobic fitness. 3. low impact exercise can benefit everyone, regardless of age.⠀ low-impact cardio workouts can be a great alternative or supplement to higher impact workouts because they allow us to build a strong aerobic base without punishing our legs and joints with more pounding. but remember to supplement cardio workouts with strength training and stretching for a solid week of fitness.⠀ bottom line: our workouts don't always have to be sweat-drenched and high impact for us to get results. low impact workouts can be just as effective in helping us reach our fitness goals as high impact ones are. and just because they’re low impact, doesn’t mean we won’t be sweating! so you know what that means, no excuses you guys! i can reassure you that this is just a good angle pic your girl does not got back..... but hey if you want to work on that with me, join me in my next challenge! 21 day booty challenge november 9th-30th last day to register is october 31st mani of the day has me all in the fall mood! aberdeen aubergine coming up rose gold happy energy!! cherry lemon pomegranate tea this morning. today has been a sampling kinda day....i do love making you guys samples ....right now, my house smells so freakin’ good!! even the ups man commented on the ‘nice smell’ coming from the house ...oh yeah....that right there mr ups man is the amazing smell of scentsy rings n thingz see how to use a brow pencil yep, seriously!, lip liner lipstick to get a perfectly posh pout it’s always a good time for some girl time our team training events seem to be more laughter then training i think we are all okay with that dream 1000 iq moment! follow @reynardtube follow @reynardtube follow @reynardtube via udream deciding to open my own business has definitely caused me to loose some sleep. all of the self doubt and negative talk has been creeping in! but then i’m reminded that there is no reward without risk. there is no moving forward if i’m staying still what if it’s the best thing ever... gosh, i hope it’s the best!! i finally ordered inventory last night and i could not sleep! scared excited and lots still to do!! stay tuned and keep watching for more information as my business gets closer to launching!! get cozy this fall season with the norwex bed sheets! did you know that you will sleep for one third of your life?

b for me save this post and feel free to share it too! welcome to when you are launching your businessnew productservice, these are the 5 things you need to have. non-negotiable. 1. know your customer. if you don't have any idea who your customer and audience is, you are heading for diaster and heartache. 2. research your competition. don't obsess over this. just be aware of some of the heavy hitters in your industry. even better, buy their products to understand their process, what they deliver, etc. 3. automate as much as you can. if you are doing digital downloads and courses, the person should get their stuff within 10 minutes. you get that through automation. 4. have funds for marketing advertising. do not rely on word of mouth, hope, organic reach, etc to have success. you must invest money and energy to make a massive impact and shift. 5. answer your damn emails! so many online businesses fail in this department. if customers have questions about products, services, shipping, etc, expect emails. answer them. answer them in a timely fashion. and if email overwhelms you, you better hire someone to handle it for you. plus, you may want to look over point again. if you need help, you may want to slide into my dm's. i have things that can help you. can we just take a second and checkout them lashes!! who wants to look amazing by thanksgiving?

typically it is using a cleanser to dissolve make up and break down sebum. ours is full of vitamin e and oil free. follow this with your water based cleanser and your face is ready to treat with products for optimal absorption. i’m hooked!!! i admit, sometimes i still use my favorite eye make up remover. when i’m done i use a squirt of pomifera pre-cleanse and i am shocked at the raccoon eyes. check out my link in bio to shop and get yours today. steps for the day there’s two sides of every coin. yep, even the “that girl” coin. day 3 of my detox cleanse in the books! this day was much easier because i was looking forward to my dinner!! started off with some warm lemon water this morning, prepped some lemon water for work, had detox juice for breakfast, fat flush smoothie for lunch, and dinner a big salad! of course apples and melon in between! read that again! got our nightly walk in. decided to change up where we walked. it was nice to walk downtown tonight! this is one of the reasons we all need to detox. i still have free samples dm to try it before you buy it... attempting to prepare for a run coming up in a couple weeks as per usual, i am behind i decided to take one of the pups with me. i think i wore us both out don’t focus on the how, focus on the action! i’ve been told plenty of times: “yeah, you do a lot!” everything in life has an occurrence! the odds in life can look like they’re against you or it could also occur as an opportunity! it’s how you look at things! i did the actions to finish school, get a degree and corporate job and still got laid off! i did the actions to start a face painting business to pay my new car note, because unemployment wasn’t enough! i did the action to start my own business when i couldn’t find corporate work! i did the action to fire myself when my cookie biz looked “sweet” on the gram—yet my life was falling apart; facing multiple pregnancy losses, postpartum depression, financial and relationships struggles! i was already in action as an herbalife nutrition client and down 55lbs! sharing the products i helped friends and family lose 500lbs—even when i said “i wasn’t doing the business” i learned in an herbalife opportunity meeting that “doing herbalife” really wasn’t difficult at all—just help others while being in action for myself! so, i did the actions to personally develop myself as a multi-level marketing leader, now my husband and i are currently in the top 6 of herbalife nutrition! being an entrepreneur has been thee most confronting journey i have ever been on! but it has been worth it! i will never forget how i felt february 12, 2010 when i was just a number on a list at that corporate job! i’d rather be in control of my actions, then rely on someone else for a paycheck! nothing wrong with working a 9-5; just wasn’t in alignment with my goals and what i wanted in life! my mom told me right before she died, “continue to stay in action! i worked hard my entire life for someone else, and have nothing to show for it!” how brings on excuses! action gets it done! how minecraft developers made the new cave updaterare footage we crave for the best minecraft... join our nation technically saying: pls follow …but seriously… join the cravers credits: evan.gb on tiktok want your minecraft clip here?

the 8x8 rule is what some experts say is needed daily and it’s one of the best things you can do for overall health. there are some great health benefits. increased energy relieves fatigue promoted weight loss removes toxins improves skin complexion maintains regularity i’m sure you are curious about commission, you earn 20-40 commission, which is crazy good for direct sales most top out around 30. here’s how it works: you warm 20 commission on every sale, paid weekly. for each sales volume milestone you reach you get paid an additional 5 on every sale refer you chart. this is paid on the 10th of every month. within the first 3-4 sales a month you’ll likely reach the first 5 commission bonus. early in my maskcara artist days, i earned a 10 commission bonus. as i’ve continued to be consistent and built my customer base, i’ve been earning a 20 commission bonus. maskcara has structured their commission and commission bonuses to be very achievable. i should also mention that there are no minimum monthly sales required to earn your commission which relieves any sales pressure. sales pressure drives awkward and unnatural activities. without a monthly minimum you are having genuine conversations and you are able to run your business as yours. happy sunday and october! if you couldn’t guess by my ears and pumpkin, october is my favorite month of the year i’m so glad that i’m already in an easy to follow fitness and nutrition routine, as candy and pie season begins. i know how to work in my favorite sweets, without ruining my diet! i’d be happy to teach you those tricks too, along with some healthy sweet recipes my october group is open and i’d love to have you join me this month! i continue to see weekly results and the scale keeps going down while my confidence and energy goes up! send me a message and i’ll send you the details brand new challenge! starting tomorrow 5th of october have a watch of the video below support from myself and other people who all want the same goal to feel fabulous again! i will add you to this amazing group that will support you on your journey. let’s feel good again! message me if you’d like to join in with me and thousands of others including danni ferne! i cannot tell y’all how excited i am for today... it has been 6 months since i was able to go to church however today is the day i get to praise the lord in his holy house. while some of you have put on weight during the quarantine i have taken pounds and inches off this dress is a size 6 i bought it years ago and couldn’t get it up past my thighs. it’s a great day. for real, what would it look like if you stopped dreaming and started doing?

so i ran for it! and i along with my team did it!!! my goal this month is to maintain that rank and then go even further to brand director! it's scary to put this out into the universe! what if i fail?! but, having a scarcity mindset of what if i fail isn't serving anyone. so, that's why i'm posting this. i'm not going to be afraid of failure. but, i do need your support! how can you show support? like and save my posts. comment on my posts. share my posts to your stories. referrals are amazing. cheer me on when i want to give up. gift yourself some dashes and lashes!

running keeps you healthier physically, emotionally and mentally!⠀ it can make you feel happy! running releases happy chemicals like serotonin in your brain, elevating your mood. it can make your body stronger! to run we must be able to support our body weight with our legs the force of our weight trains our muscles and bones to become stronger. it can burn calories! running spends crazy calories. especially during marathons! the more energy you spend, the more calories you burn, and the more strong and fit you become. i have a whole list of the benefits of running! want it? drop me an emoji and i'll shoot it over to you!

as crazy and unpredictable this year has been, i still feel like “how the heck are there only 3 months left in the year!” in anticipation for the busy month ahead, i took the last 2 weeks off from my workouts… gasp! i know, a little sacrilegious, huh. but here’s the thing…the time off did not set me back or throw me off from my goals. the opposite is true. this rest and recovery period is exactly what my body needed to get ready for for the launch of the new running program 30-day breakaway and the 35 mile breast cancer run challenge i committed to with the american cancer association. it also allowed me to get laser focused on my nutrition. my experience has thought me that while exercise is an important part of fitness, fueling my body with healthy foods is what matters most!

you’ll also have access to maskcara school, an audible library filled with personal and professional development books, weekly power hours and multiple facebook groups filled with artists willing to help with what you need! i’ve used it all and you know what?! it’s material and resources that work! money, money, money it is not a fun subject to talk about but did you know that 8 out of 10 american workers say they live paycheck to paycheck? are you struggling single parent? are you at a job you hate? are you someone who wants more freedom? what would you do with an extra $250-$300 a month? what would that mean for your family? i am here to show you how this side hustle has been such a blessing not only to the health of ours but financially too! it is just too good not to share! {{plexus makes no guarantees on income, as such representations may be misleading. your success depends on your effort, commitment, skill and leadership abilities and how effectively you exercise those abilities. let’s debunk our grandparent’s belief that we shouldn’t talk about money or that it’s “unladylike” to want it. money is energy, and ya need it to live. it’s 2020, and with so many ways to make extra money in addition to your “career” job, i don’t know many people who aren’t thinking of some kind of side gig; but if you’re smart, that extra income is coming from a direct sales business. why? the earning potential is uncapped, you’re not trading hours for dollars, and the business can be run wherever you have wifi. seems like a no-brainer to me dining room is fall ready!!

you trash on yourself and just never do anything with the photo? there’s got to be so many photos like this for women out there. cast away pictures that show their beauty but they just don’t see it. then you look back years later and think “what was i thinking?!” “i was so skinny!” or “i used to be so cute”. we all want to feel beautiful in our own skin. working with monat is giving me a confidence and perspective that i havent seen before. beauty is everywhere. potential is everywhere. i keep seeing signs about not giving up, being consistent, having patience, and most importantly, just starting. start somewhere. if you think you’re not ready, do it anyways. take a risk, work hard, and have faith. i’ll be right here with you. the best is yet to come got a walk in this evening! so this week i have been feeling under the weather i honestly think it is a lack of rest and i am just stressing about getting approve for a home loan so we can get this house we are in up for sale i know god has everything plan out for us well i did get a nap in also today and feel much better so heres to getting my workout in today how is your health are you getting your workouts in daily if not i would love to help you get yourself healthy message me for details have a great rest of your evening just finished this great evening workout @sosonya15. now finishing this great vitamin packed, super food having, clinically proven, all natural, stress reducing, energizing drink. yasssssssssss!!! who’s ready for a winter wonderland?

why is this so hard?! when did i become so out of shape? what's wrong with me?! we all start from different spots in our life. the common goal... we are working to be healthy. whether it's weight loss, muscle gain, better eating or more activity... the common goal is what brings us together. this is what we celebrate in my online community... progress, not perfection. and also no judgement! we share honesty, motivation and support. and this is what kept me going for my first 21 days. i worked through my doubts and completed all 21 days of that program! four years later i'm still progressing towards a healthier lifestyle. i know it's hard, and new, and even scary to start. i get it. but i also know how great you can feel when you make progress towards your goals. my next online group starts soon and i have a spot for you! and as a bonus, join me tonight for an online sneak peek into my community. message me, it's progress in the right direction financial freedom travel living life on your own time community friendships incentives changing lives being home with your kids whatever your reason is for being curious about what i do- own it girl we all start for different reasons but we all start here!! with $19 it got me all those things plus so much more!! if all those things are worth $19 to you... drop me a and i'll send you the details p.s. woke up this morning to another pay raise!!!! tiki island super lit tea! sooooo amazing!!! today is a funfetti day for sure! bring your own sunshine, sprinkle a rainbow! healthy lunch for us but deeeeeeelicious!! happy month end to all you hustlers out there!! i’m just like you running a direct sales gig and running for goals today! back to regularly scheduled content tomorrow!! how can i cheer you on?! what are you or you and your team running for today?! do the reach outs. ask.⁣ follow up.⁣ know you’re worthy of success. one choice you're always one choice away from changing your life... i made a choice almost a year ago to join @maverickthecollection i was that person that would peep and stalk other boutique owners... other network marketers... i sat on the sidelines watching their businesses thrive, watching them have fun, living life to it's fullest and thought i can't do it... however, it dawned on me that's not me... i'm always up for a challenge and after many back and forths i decided to dive in... 100... if i was going to be a bear i was definitely going to be a grizzly... mlm's have such a negative wrap... and yes there are mlm's out there that are trash and feed into those stereotypes... not mine... not maverick the collection... we truly are different than any other network marketing company around... a group of gals that want each and everyone of us to succeed... soooo my advice to you is this... if you're standing on the outside of the ring waiting to hop on in... just do it! you won't win any fight if you don't get in that ring and give it a solid go at it... have you been peeping my profile?

do people come to you for fashion advice? if you answered yes to any of these questions... let's chat!l... it could be the choice that alters your life... stop wishing and make it happen! the romeo denim jacket, jensen top and benji pantsjoggers “we should all start to live, before we get too old. fear is stupid. so are regrets.” -marilyn monroe have you taken a chance lately, taken a road trip, camped, gotten out of quarantine mode...cause you should.... it’s amazing! you can still stay away and enjoy life! thank you for the quote today! @sweetswede73 today is national women's health and fitness day, a day dedicated to promoting health for women of all ages!⠀ here are some ideas on how we can celebrate today: 1. work out with a friend! schedule a zoom workout or meet outside for a workout or a walk. it will be fun and motivating!⠀ 2. eat superfoods! think broccoli, apples, turnips, berries, eggs need more ideas? hit me up! 3. treat yourself to a healthy beauty treatment or a massage. self-care is a huge part of healthy living!⠀ diy olive oil and lemon juice face mask: protects the skin from the damaging effects of the uv rays of the sun. mix equal portions of olive oil and lemon juice in a bowl. warm it up for a few minutes and apply it as a mask. let dry for 15 minutes and rinse off with cold water. diy massage for shoulders or back: lay on the floor with a tennis ball placed near the area that hurts most, such as your lower back or between your shoulder blades. roll the tennis ball around until you hit the spot that's most tender, and lie there for 1 to 5 minutes, or until you feel your muscles relax.⠀ 4. drink lots of water and stay hydrated. not a fan of plain water? add fresh fruit such as lemons, limes, and oranges, or try crushing fresh raspberries, watermelon or strawberry slices into your water. cucumber and fresh mint also work well 5. eat dark chocolate! dark chocolate 70-85 cocoa is rich in antioxidants and minerals.⠀ dark chocolate peanut butter fruit dip: ¼ cup 4 tbsp. unsweetened almond milk, divided use⠀ 1 tbsp. 1 tsp. all-natural smooth peanut butter⠀ 1 scoop chocolate super foods shake⠀ combine ¼ cup almond milk, peanut butter, and chocolate super foods shake in a medium bowl; mix well. add remaining almond milk, 1 tbsp. at a time; mix until well blended and smooth. serve it with berries, banana, or pineapple for a special treat. enjoy! we are all busy, but it's so important to add exercise and healthy living into our daily schedule. and i don't just mean today, because it's i mean everyday! let's make it a point to invest in our health the best investment we'll ever make! can i tell you a secret? i know i might regret it later but i feel like if i'm going to show up here i feel like i have to do it for realzzzzz, like what’s the point of showing up if i'm still afraid to be who i really am. this hasn't been easy. it's been a long journey to get where i'm at. showing up on social media, taking selfies, making videos like who am i? i used to be the shy, quiet girl who hated taking pictures, was always nervous of looking like a fool, saying something wrong, being laughed at well i finally decided enough. i’m done giving into these self- limiting beliefs and thoughts. last summer i was watching my son kai skimboard on the shore. he’s really good and a group of girls walked over and asked him to try it. i realized i would never have done that when i was their age. i would have sat by and watched and even if i was asked, “hey do you wanna try this? do you want a turn?” i’d say ‘nah, it’s ok” …….not because i didn't want to do it, but because i was afraid of making a fool of myself or being embarrassed. know what i mean? most of us have that annoying voice in our head that is constantly putting ourselves down: “you can't do that”; “what will they think”; “you're embarrassing yourself” uggh we wouldn't say those things to our friends or our kids so why do we say them to ourselves? i've decided to stop. i've made a conscious choice to shut up that negative bitch inside my head. i was told it helps to give the voice a name. so i’ve named mine debbie and when debbie starts talking smack, i tell her, “debbie your opinion is not needed here” so i'm wondering, do you struggle with negative self-talk? do you wanna join me and unburden yourself from the limitations these shitty thought patterns place on you and all that you were meant to do. let’s lift ourselves up and speak kindly to ourselves like we would talk to someone we love. tell me, comment below what name will you give to your negative self-voice? i’d love to be a part of your journey. we can walk together, try new things, make fools of ourselves and laugh along the way. still time message me for details people say i got a drinking problem... ...yeah i do on my vale 30 liquid vitamins. all it takes is one shot a day. until i started this business, i had barely any photos of me! there was always something wrong with the photo or i’d be the one behind the camera. i was looking through photos with the kids today and they made a comment about how great it is to see photos of me and them. that those photos are some of their favourites. my camera roll has exploded since saying yes to this opportunity. are the photos great? not even close. does it matter? not one bit. if we spend our lives waiting for perfection, all we end up doing is waiting. this is about so much more than skincare. did you know that when you lose weight your calves might get smaller? well mine did! it has never happened to me before. i have always had to buy wide calf boots. i think i will be able to buy regular calf boots now!!! not to late to join in the fun! our next girl get together is being planned now road trip to sc been thinking about becoming a maskcara artist?!? now is the time you could earn extra cash for christmas shopping!!! but spoiler you will love it so much you won’t stop!! come hang out with us and have the time of your life!! want to know more? ask me all the questions!! girlpreneur you can watch me, mock me, block me, or join me whatever you choose, you can’t stop me. i’ll never let myself get left behind again. what about you? consider these numbers next time someone says it’s “too expensive” to start a side gig, or if they ask you “why do i have to pay anything to start? that doesn’t make sense!” direct sales requires a minimal start up cost for the business kit. companies that are members of the dsa offer 90 buyback, too. becoming a realtor requires you to pay for licensing testing, training, marketing materials, membership fees, and state costs. there is also zero refund on that investment. oh, and be prepared to give up all your weekends considering becoming a uber or lyft driver? well, you need to cover costs of a car auto loan or lease, maintenance, insurance, gas, there’s no refund on depreciation...and yep, you’re trading hours for dollars want to franchise a restaurant? okay, daddy warbucks! you need upwards of $500k $1m to cover franchise licensing, rentpurchase of location, city licensing, paying employees. that’s a ton of risk for zero refund on investment if things don’t work out. and restaurant hours? direct sales is smart. it’s the future. there is little to no risk, yet the opportunity to make the income you desire is great. sounds pretty sweet if you ask me source: direct selling association today is rest day, hump day, wednesday... whichever day it is for you, enjoy it to the fullest! as the quote says ‘if you get tired, learn to rest, not to quit’ i have quit far too many times. today, i woke up tired, i knew it was my stretch and recover day, and could just do it later, but crawled out of bed and i pushed through it... by the end of it, i wanted more... so i decided to add an extra 20 minute workout! sometimes when you want to quit, you push yourself to do the minimum and end up wanting to do more. change isn’t easy, pushing yourself when you don’t want to is a challenge but knowing when to take a rest is crucial. lack of rest when we need it, more often than not, turns to quitting. this isn’t just about fitness, it’s about support and my community always shows up together. way to wear your fit tribe. we are welcoming anyone and everyone into our fam. last day to grab up my giveaway too! never a better time to jump in with us. @beingabel @runnerenr14 went for lunch yesterday so wore fm 16. i went to my in laws at the weekend and they couldn't believe how much it smelt like jimmy choo, so much so they asked me to order 2 bottles! morning looks like its going to be an ok day good morning, it's the end of the month. i apologize for not being as engaged as i used to be. i've been focusing on myself and my happiness. one day my truth will be someone courage, motivation and inspiration. tomorrow is the start of a new month. join the challenge with me. details tomorrow. it's all about living and loving. a healthy lifestyle journey. be the girl who motivates and pushes other girls to go a little harder. kettle ball work today and i swear we all died a little. we made it though and today were 1 better than we were yesterday. fringe benefits sweater dusty blue give us all the fringe and all the benefits of looking cute this season. pair this adorable sweater with jeans and booties all fall long. dusty blue, long sleeve, women's knit pullover sweater featuring fringe detailing, round neckline, and ribbed trim. still available in all sizes; small 1xl fit details: julianna is 5’6, size 1, 32c and is shown wearing a small. fit is true to size, slightly fitted. melissa is 5'3, 150 lbs, 38d, size 9 in kan cans and wears a large in this. i’m 5’5”, 138lbs, a 34dd, and a size 5 in kan cans and i’m wearing a medium in the black version. link to my boutique is in my bio, or comment link for the direct link to the sweater. fringe benefits sweater dusty blue give us all the fringe and all the benefits of looking cute this season. pair this adorable sweater with jeans and booties all fall long. dusty blue, long sleeve, women's knit pullover sweater featuring fringe detailing, round neckline, and ribbed trim. still available in all sizes; small 1xl fit details: julianna is 5’6, size 1, 32c and is shown wearing a small. fit is true to size, slightly fitted. melissa is 5'3, 150 lbs, 38d, size 9 in kan cans and wears a large in this. i’m 5’5”, 138lbs, a 34dd, and a size 5 in kan cans and i’m wearing a medium in the black version. link to my boutique is in my bio, or comment link for the direct link to the sweater. mood watching this who do you think won?

the short answer is yes! a balm will sit on the top of your skin and a salve will absorb into the skin. salves are generally softer than balms. the concentration of oils to beeswax varies with salves having higher amounts of oils. ours uses the unique pomifera oil. not only will it help with extremely dry chapped lips but heal cold sores and fever blisters at the emphasis is not on the difference. it is on the fact we are creating an all natural healing product avoiding toxic ingredients you may find in commercially made brands. check out link in bio or dm me for more information. if you’re curious about what that direct sales chick does, freaking ask her. she’s not going to ask you for your first born child or a dna swab or ask you to marry her. she’ll answer your questions so you can find out if this is the right opportunity for you. because how pissed will you be when someone else in your network who’s just as smart and successful and well-connected as you asks first...and she earns everything that’s available to you right now?

maskcara! but what keeps them together is more than the makeup. the sisterhood!! i know you hear me say it all the time but the sisterhood is one of most rewarding perks of being a maskcara artist. knowing that if i need anything day or night i can reach out to one of them for the answer or the support. we all come different walks on life. but we all have common goals. helping women to not only feel beautiful but believe they are. we are not all cut from the same mold and we are all beautiful in our own way! i will say this everyday if i have to “joining maskcara was the best decision i have made in a long time” girlpreneur they told me i couldn’t, that’s why i did. london. love it! if i offered you a 5 all inclusive holiday for £156 most people would bite my hand off but when i offer you a risk free business opportunity for £156 that could potentially make you enough money to go on as many holidays as you like it's suddenly too much money why?

im not asking you to kill it on day one if youre seriously willing to start we can progress together! october's challenge is creeping up. register with me today! finally received my mp box. can't wait to see what this new journey will bring into my life. better late than never!!! full day of work...returned clothes, went grocery shopping, cooked dinner, took 3 quizzes and then decided to work out!!! energy for days!!! woot woot!! who agrees... one of the reasons our industry can get such a bad rap is because once someone joins a direct sales company, they turn into weird robots who’s seen the drill susie q joins a company and right off the bat, she’s coached to emulate her up, up, upline who’s made millions of dollars and now runs an evangelical church and orphanage in a third world county. while that’s lovely...it’s not susie q. one of the most detrimental things i see happen is when women try to pull this weird chameleon stunt and it never, ever, ever works. sis, if she ain’t the best version of you, don’t emulate her. yes, successful people have obviously done something right along the way, but the most powerful thing you can do in this business is be yourself.⁣ if you swear like a sailor, keep at it. if you’ve always woven bible versus into your social media, amen. if you have always had strong opinions, keep ‘em! if you don’t know wtf a “flat lay” or a preset is, don’t change! if you would never say “hey, dollface!” to someone in real life, don’t fucking say it in a reach out just because that’s what some chick in your upline does. it doesn’t matter if something worked for someone else. if you lose your authenticity in hopes of gaining approval, likes, and sales...it’s never gonna click. ⁣just be yourself i set a lot of big goals for myself this month.⠀ and you know what? i don't think i've hit a single one of them!⠀ most people would be quite discouraged by that...and trust me, that's completely normal.⠀ it actually takes a lot of effort to not feel like that!⠀ but if i've learned anything in life, dreaming big is better than not dreaming at all. and when you dream big, you won't always succeed on the first try. maybe not even on the second, third, or fourth try. but you just keep going!⠀ why? because i truly believe that if it's meant to be...it will happen. maybe just not on your time...⠀ as for this month, i will allow myself to feel disappointed for a hot minute...not much longer. i will dust myself off and i will try again!⠀ i believe in you. i believe in me. keep dreaming big my friends!⠀ if you’re ready to crush some goals this month, my october wellness group is opening soon! let’s chat! having my workouts seen in social media was putting myself way out of my comfort zone. however, i decided to do it anyway. why? to stay accountable towards my health goals. to show people working out at home is possible. staying away from the quarantine 15 knowing people are genuinely concerned.. lol wondering hey is everything ok? i haven't seen you post?. do you need help staying accountable? it's not too late too start! if you have discipline drive and determination... nothing is impossible. don’t just wake up and think about the woman you want to become, wake up and be her because remember a dream doesn’t become reality through magic. it takes sweat, determination, hard work. i have loved loved loved this hair journey and being a market partner sooo much that i am doing an incredible offer. this comes from me personally and is not affiliated with monat as a company! if you decide to join me in this hair journey as a market partner this month, i am offering a $50 scholarship from me!!! this is a huge savings!!!! pm for details on how the scholarship works! my today goals on walkingstep i’ve walked one of the coolest things with color street is that you can use a matte or shiny liquid top coat on color street... because color street is 100 nail polish! matte or glossy?! get either look now!!! https:www.colorstreet.comdivanaildynastyparty1744936 what will you do exile, when there is nothing left but to live.... or die?

it's an awesome way to reduce stress and keep our energy up, it can increase our self-confidence, it improves sleep, it's time we get to ourselves if we so choose, and, so much more!⠀ there's no question that our lives right now are different than they used to be, but that doesn't mean we can't take control of our health and fitness. think about it, all the new technology that keeps us sedentary also offers us so many ways to be active! we just have to take advantage of them!⠀ trust me, there's something out there for every one of us if we take the time and effort to look or make it easy for yourself, let's talk, and i'll help you find it! in those 3 days, you can see results with energy, weight loss, inch loss, or all. to get yours today. it is always good to lead by example, so here is my story on my transformation journey! in 2014, i had gained 55 lbs from a pregnancy. i had lost about 15 or so pounds right away but could not lose the rest no matter what i tried. i hated the way i looked and would barely take pictures. everyone would get mad at me because i would refuse to take family pictures for special events, but no one understood how depressed this girl was inside. i had also started suffering with high blood pressure. i was put on medication and told i should try to lose some weight. my husband who is a workout buff, decided he was going to train me. he researched like crazy on the proper exercises for a woman so he can train me the right way to help me lose weight. we went to the gym 5 days a week and tried a few different eating habits. nothing worked. my doctor decided to run some tests, but everything came back normal. i became even more depressed inside and just gave up. in january 2018, a co-worker told me about keto and her success on it. i went back to my desk, and told my husband about it. he was a little against it at first because of the amount of fat we had to eat and of course we were all brought up to believe that fat is bad for us. but since he knew i was at my wits end and really wanted to lose the weight and nothing else had worked, he told me he was giving it 4 weeks. even though he was hesitant, he has always done what was needed to support me. that night i went to the store, shopped for whatever we needed to start and never looked back. i finally found what worked and the food was amazing. i went from a size 10-12 to a size 2. i am no longer that depressed girl, and i enjoy being in pictures again. ⁠one thing i have learned is that this journey is never over. you must stay consistent to keep the weight off. you also must change things up. after almost 3 years, i have decided it is time for me to add to my lifestyle and start taking ketones. i have seen the amazing results it has given people i know. if you would like to know more on how i can help you achieve real goals, ask me how. comment below. instagram algorithm has been kicking a lot of our aes atleast from what i am seeing a lot of artistsmakers talking. it has definitely been a difficult month for me. when your work gets seen less, the less you sell. the less you sell, the more you're let down. and it consistently gets you demotivated because you think your work isn't good enough! but can we all take a moment and remember why are we doing what we do, in the first place? i started painting long before i ever had any selling thoughts in my head. i painted because i wanted to. i painted because it brought me joy. but then instagram happened and it spoilt me. i got a taste of how it is to put up a post and have it sold in a matter of minutes. and i started craving that for each and every work of mine! but is that what i want? is that why i paint? definitely, not! ask yourselves that. likes, shares, comments do not matter. it does not matter if you sell. because trust me, you will. eventually. if not today, then tomorrow, a year from you. somebody will see your work and it will speak to them. having said that, i am going to dedicate the next month of october to creativity, without worrying about these stupid algorithms. i will do my own version of and paint a painting everyday. no prompts, no required medium, no limitations. just my own version. come join me, if you'd like to as well it’s hard to get fit. my results didn’t happen over night they took time. i sure am proud of the woman staring at herself in the mirror feeling confident, fit, and healthy. not going to lie but after giving birth i was not happy seeing my body the way it was but i knew i would comeback stronger than ever. you know what i did!and then some more! i have lost even more weight than my pre-pregnancy weight and gained muscle massthere is no better feeling like feeling amazing inside and out! stop watching. stop holding yourself back. let me guide you dm me or click the link in my bio beautiful grow @trustysanchez23 can we take a moment to appreciate that i have lashes with this new double effect farmasi mascara??

what about how you show up in your career, business, professionally, or just the external facing world. whether or not we like to admit it, we've all developed a personal brand and reputation in our ecosystem. but have you been intentional and purposeful about it? chances are you probably haven't, and that's okay! it's give you plenty of white space to reset and rebrand yourself, thoughtfully. why is this important? because how you show up in any space, is how people will perceive you. if you don't carefully craft this critical messaging, you leave it to chance. this isn't just for executives, celebrities, or the rich and wealthy. it's even more imperative for the everyday professional and entrepreneur since it heavily influences in on how present yourself to potential clients, customers, hiring managers, etc. meaning there's a direct connection to the opportunities you may or may not have. i've created a free great hack guide to help professionals and entrepreneurs curate this process to-day! or tomorrow at work: this guide will help you understand what tangible, actionable, and practical steps you can start to use asap! you'll learn quick hacks in your communication, how to think about your executive presence without being an executive and your gravitas.⁠ this is a gooooood one, i promise you. will. not. want. miss. grab your free copy with the link in my bio!!!!⁠ i got to the hotel gym yesterday morning to do my workout before hitting the road back home and someone else was already in there working out. i mean isn’t that what people do?!? lol. anyway, my point is the old me would’ve been like um, no! i’m out! i would’ve came up with a reason to leave and not gotten in my workout. especially considering it was someone of the opposite sex. lol. like, um i don’t want him to know that i don’t know what i’m doing or give him a reason to give me funny looks. lol. the thought to leave actually briefly went through my mind as i looked down and realized i wore my flip flops instead of tennis shoes. haha. i just removed them and did my workout barefoot as i usually do at home. but no that’s not who i am now! the new me can walk in the gym with confidence knowing i’m going to crush the hell out of my workout because i have my netflix of workouts with an amazing trainer showing me all the moves, suggesting how much weight to use, and reminding me to use proper form. so i just set up my ipad and phone like i would at home and got to it. y’all, i’m really so proud of myself for stepping outside of my comfort zone and crushing the hell out of my workout. i’m also pretty dang proud of myself for getting up earlier so i could get in my workouts every day while i was gone without interfering with our fun time. my nutrition while i was away... well maybe not as on point as my fitness but i still drank my daily dense superfood shake, all the water and tried being mindful of what i ate. i didn’t deprive myself of anything i wanted. i just lived and enjoyed my life. my point is that i am more mindful of my fitness and nutrition now that i know how good it feels to live a healthier lifestyle. sure there are times i skip a workout or eat crap foods but i know i’m going to pay for it later. are you ready to gain your confidence and crush your workouts? are you in need of some accountability? are you looking for some fit friends? do you need someone to walk you through living and being a healthier version of you? then message me and let’s go! my october bootcamp registration now open. see link in bio. when your customer base likes pumpkin! when i’m taking my 2 shakes a day, i’m also doing my meal preps for the week they are important!! “deep type” was my first release at the beginning of the pandemic i am soon releasing my fourth. who do i think i am? i am the daughter of the most high to god be the glory who has given me the supernatural ability to do this by faith at the age of 50. thanks to everyone who has supported my independent artist endeavors by working with me in any capacity and also by going to download my music exclusively sold on my website. click link in bio www.sherreepatrice.comshop-1 i know the process is not as convenient as going and listening to an artist’s music for free 99. now days we as artist need over one million streams to get paid incomparable thousands in exchange for our craft. it works because we as artists have settled for it to and a lot of artist are broke and struggling financially, forcing us to another form of trade source of employment. if we are being honest i believe the digital platforms cater to more to established and well known artist but in this season that is not my portion and has not worked for me in the past. after being in the music industry for over 30 years. i am simply starting over and it’s completely okay. mainly because i split the revenue with my co writer and co producer. so they too are not working for independent artist for free 99. so you see, this is bigger than just me! when you support my music, the co producer and co writer benefit from my independent project which is rare i am fully aware that this method is not for everybody.... but it may just be for you is left over whilst doing some back office work with my team. hands up! how many of you are fed up of your weight?

anyone else a planner?! today i finished up the fat-burning workout program i’ve been doing daily for the past 6 weeks and i was having the hardest time figuring out what i want to do next. normally, i follow along with my online accountability groups and complete the newest program. this new program is a 30-day strength training program combined with running the first of its kind for the health and fitness company i’ve been working with for the past 5 years! at the end, you complete a virtual 5k. i’ve always told myself i’m not a runner see my post a few days ago about my one and only 5k! but i was really contemplating giving this program a try. the trainer guides you through each run, teaching you how to breathe, stand, pace yourself, etc. however, given my current schedule and not wanting to run outside in the dark at 6am, i am going to likely wait on this one. so what’s next? i’m going back to my soulmate program, insanity max30 this program got me on this journey back in 2015, and this will be my tenth round. it also got me in the best shape of my life. it’s crazy, super high intensity cardio, tabata and strength training in just 30 minutes, 6 days a week. there is a modifier if you want to take it at your own pace i actually followed the modifier while preggo with joey! watch my stories beginning tomorrow to see how crazy these workouts are! so, i have my next 60 days planned out. and then i’ll choose something else from my digital fitness library it’s so easy to stay on this journey when you have the right tools! there are just 14 weeks left in 2020 you can spend them making healthy changes or you can keep making excuses. there’s never going to be a right time so what are you waiting for!? you can dread trying to find those holiday outfits even if you’re wearing them to your living room or you can feel comfortable, strong confident there are so many programs to choose from depending on your goals, abilities interests i can help you choose the one that’s best for you. are you ready to finish the year strong with me?! i had a friend say to me tonight 𝘐'𝘮 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘺 𝘪𝘯 𝘢𝘸𝘦 𝘰𝘧 𝘩𝘰𝘸 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘥𝘰 𝘪𝘵 𝘢𝘭𝘭 while it's 10pm on sunday and i have a list of about 20 things i needed to get done this weekend that i didn't. when i read the message swear a record player 𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗲𝗲𝗲𝗲𝗲𝗲𝗲𝘁𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗱 in the background and everything went silent. i was thankful for the compliment but it made me realize that i must be showing too much of the highlight reel because i definitely don't do it all. well actually, i do a lot but i don't feel lately like i do anything great particularly lately.⁣ i lose my patience with my kids. i yell at my husband. i get behind with tasks at work. my kids are wearing capris because their pants don't fit them anymore and they need new clothes. i could probably clothe three versions of myself one pregnant with all the old clothes in my closet. i binge in at night. i waste way too much time on tiktok. i'm often not a good listener because my brain is always thinking about the next thing i need to do. please please know that i am trying to get my shit together just like everyone else. we all have different experiences and struggles but please don't think that me or anyone is doing it all or at least doing it all well. i think that may be the one of the best parts of joining my accountability group is that we share our lives and what we are each going through and struggling with. i get to work on myself alongside you. it's not that i am the pinnacle and you are trying to achieve that. i'm putting the hard work in right along with you, sister.

it is soooo hard to get wrapped up in the do’s and don’ts of infertility life, retrieval, transfer, post transfer...heck becoming a mom, being a mom, parenting...life in general. two days ago i drank a bubbly and have been stewing over whether or not i should have drank it, not remembering whether or not carbonation was ok or was it just the high sugars i had to worry about- looked it up yesterday and guess what it’s the carbonation that is bad!!!!! then i panicked the rest of the day after feeling a sharp jab in my abdomen?!?! this is the emotional rollercoaster. i keep reminding myself to smile through. there has been so much heavy going on around me that it’s made this last transfer hard to focus on. i have 7 days left till we have our bloodwork done and i’m going to put myself in a bubble; happy thoughts, dreaming of tomorrow, pampering, snuggles, praying and trusting gods plan for us through this last go around brushed hair and put it in a pony this morning. it took me 30 seconds. no filter. a repairing and hydrating masque ideal for damaged and moisture-starved hair that penetrates and nurtures the scalp while helping boost natural hair growth, improve follicle strength, and reduce hair thinning. infuses essential moisture and delivers vital nutrients to help eliminate frizz and reduce split ends. hair is left silky, more manageable and youthful looking. safe to use on colored or chemically treated hair and extensions. @woodbrigdeofficial have you thought about trying our skincare?

why am i doing this? my why: hair change personal growth financial freedom helping others i needed a change in my hair. i have never had amazing hair before. it’s always been dull, frizzy, and literally had a mind of it’s own. but joining monat was me taking back my hair. the thought of it becoming a reality bring tears to my eyes. i also need a change in my finances. i am not a person who likes just sitting back while others hustle their way through life. i am extremely independent. they care about you, they want you to succeed and hit your goals! i wouldn’t market or sell a product i didn’t believe in. i joined this company to help others change their hair and get away from harsh chemicals that are typically found in drugstore and other low-end products. this isn’t a scheme. this isn’t me trying to steal your money. i have seen the success this company can bring. this is an effort to show that these products have changed my hair and they can change yours too. take the chance, your hair is worth it. want to see what my team looks like?

drop a comment i’ve learned a lot about photography especially in the last five years. but one lesson specifically is angles. i mean, we all know that we want to shoot high rather than low to get rid of our double chin or our big thighs. but what i’m really talking about is this. a photographers favorite time to shoot is the golden hour basically that glowly time of the evening when the sun is setting. the goal is to have your clients back towards the sun. maybe a tree in the background, but something to cover the sun from hitting your lens directly. but if you don’t have the tree, pole, small building blocking the sun it blows out the picture boom, it’s over exposed. just one small adjustment to the angle your photo can be beautiful. but you have to intentionally set yourself up for success. look for those places shoot accordingly. often we are in a hurry due to time restrictions. so we don’t always pivot get those perfect angles like we should. life is crazy similar to this analogy. we don’t have the time to make the proper health decisions, parenting choices, double check our work, etc. but if you just take a quick step back and review your work you’ll see that it doesn’t take much to have things at the correct angle and it makes all the difference. so maybe today it was rough, tomorrow you can come at it from a different direction have a completely different outcome. never stop adjusting. it’s all about how you critique yourself grow from it daily. do you have dry, frizzy hair? do you curl or straighten your hair?⠀ do you use dry shampoo? there is days left this month to snag this kit that is loaded of hydration, repair, and protection for 40 off! “growth is not always constant forward motion. sometimes, growth is staying still. sometimes, growth is deep rest. sometimes, growth is stopping to reconsider where you’re headed. sometimes, growth is letting yourself settle, sometimes it is letting yourself blossom, sometimes, it is learning how to appreciate what is already good in your life because there is so much that you aren’t seeing.” braised short ribs?!!! you guys i have not tried these but it’s on the menu! look so good martie kraus! martie you look so good too! i am super excited and ready to share with everyone that i have started a new adventure with a monat business. earlier this year, a neighbor reached out to me and asked “are you interested in trying new shampoo?” i wasn’t emotionally attached to my current products and my hair has always been pretty lifeless, even more so after experiencing postpartum hair loss and not giving my hair the attention it deserved after having a child. the only time i ever felt good about my hair was the day after leaving the hair salon. not to mention, all the hair products i was using had chemicals in them which weren’t helping my scalp. so, i bought the shampoo without thinking twice and even signed up to be a vip. after only a couple months, my hair went from the picture on the left to the one on the right. i’ve consistently been using monat for 4 months, and my hair has gotten thicker, longer, healthier, smoother, and shinier for the first time in my life. without a doubt, monat has worked a miracle on my hair! monat is a naturally-based, non-toxic, plant-based, age prevention, and an all-around amazing hair care and skincare line! it is clinically proven to provide visibly longer, fuller, stronger, younger looking hair in 90 days. the products are made in the usa, do not use any harsh chemicals no parabens, sulfates, phthalates, etc., they are non-gmo, vegan and not tested on animals. so, are you ready to try monat? yay! let’s do this!! i am having a facebook live launch party for my business on wednesday, july 29th at 8pm central time. i would love to see you there! request to join my monat community on facebook here https:www.facebook.comgroups215520966352848. if you join my facebook live party you will be entered to win a free giveaway. plus, this is the place where i will share exclusive announcements, host giveaways and answer questions. i am so excited to be starting on this adventure, and i cannot wait for you to join me!!! if you have any questions, or want help on your hair send me a private message! my hair routine for during shower after shower. 1. black 2-in-1 shampooconditioner for my oily scalp 2. renew shampoo from the mid shift of my hair down to the tips 3. replenish masque to help relieve dryness in my hair 4. volumizing conditioner. after towel drying hair: 1. unknot detangler 2. air dry cream when air drying or 3. thermal shield when using heat tools ta-da!! this is my hair as of right now my hair has never been this straight, shiny, and healthy in over 10 years or so. ask me how and i will help you reach your healthy hair or skin care goals. have you ever stopped and really thought about what you want your future to look like?⁣ as a kid i wanted to be a marine biologist, then a nurse, then a math teacher, and somehow i ended up with a degree in interior design. my view of the future has changed over the years. and it still continues to change.⁣ i never wanted to be a stay at home mom, but little did i know that’s what god wanted for me and what my future held. i didn’t want dogs, and here we are with two. the point is. you don’t have to have it all figured out all the time. plans change, things change. allow your dreams to evolve. allow yourself to go for whatever it is that future life you want looks like. my current future plan i’m working on, is booking trips for our family wherever we want to go, when we want to with zero financial worry. because we deserve reward. and because some of my best memories with my dad are when we were on vacation, and i want to give that to my kids too. evolving our future. summer must have!!! link in bio what kind of products do i use to wash my hair!?

i am shy af, and had the worst anxiety being on camera. i am not usually one to be active so much on my socials so i knew that was another thing i would have yet to overcome if i was going to do this and take it seriously. i wanted to first trust the products. so as i used the products and saw change in my hair quality, this is when i decided, yes i’m going to do this business. i started with the thoughts of, just how uncomfortable i was about to be with the idea that i would never be able to do what the other girlsguys did in monat be that confident, i could never be a leader i thought. i thought of what people would think.. as of now, this business has brought such an amazing support system. these girls supported me and continue to do so, when my friends and family wouldn’t. i now have the confidence to work through my anxiety on camera than letting it defeat me. when i record myself by myself, i no longer have to distract my mind with low music in the background yes, that is what i did to film myself i am becoming confident, and i continue to grow as i stay working at it. this is only the beginning and i am proud of not just myself but the girls on my team, who i see flourishing and doing amazing things for their business as well. thank you to @xoxobianccaa for joining me on the call and presenting your story. it’s a beautiful one and i’m so happy to have been there to experience it, you inspire me! i am beyond excited i’ll be right here triple barrel curling my hair for the rest of my life it’s super important for you to be using a good silicone free heat protectant like the one i love goes up to 450f, not that you should use pizza oven heat on your hair, ever. link in bio! bangs can change your outlook so much! yassss feeling good... like i should blouse @wildintentions sunglasses shoes @clothz.ca high waist pants @lechateau gle63s @mercedesbenzbarrie want longer, stronger, healthier hair?

family being a family means you are a part of something bigger than yourself. it means you will love and be loved for the rest of your life. i listened to a training earlier today that said 90 of women millionaires are in direct sales. ninety. percent.⠀ once you dive into a business like monat, that stigma surrounding direct sales or those opinions that you were so concerned about vanish because you see it for what it truly is...⠀⠀ an opportunity.⠀ an opportunity to provide for your family. to quit that second job. to pay your mortgage. to be a stay-at-home mom. to buy that boat in cash. to earn that fully paid for cadillac and those all inclusive vacations. it is an opportunity that allows you to dream your wildest dreams and then gives you the map to get you there. i want to have a job that can support my family but i also want to be able to be home with my family. and this direct sales company, this bottle of shampoo, gives me that opportunity. so, you can find me sitting on my living room floor, in between a fake plant and a blanket basket, talking to my phone all about how much i love these products because i'm not taking this opportunity for granted. and if you ever want to join me, there's always room on my living room floor! i’m in love with these new clips! i love finding new ways to do my hair or new accessories! they say, “your why should make you cry” ...yup! that sounds about right! these two put me through the ringer last night, and we all ended in tears. they are my reason for breakdowns and breakthroughs “don’tcha wish your hair was full like mine?” “don’tcha wish your hair was shiney like mine?” “don’tcha wish your hair was healthy like mine?” don’tcha?

i have worked with so many hair products and companies like redken, aveda, matrix, amika, and literally the list goes on. i never have had a better experience than with monat. i also have never realized how many disgusting chemicals and garbage that are in these products and even worse drug store products. monat is safe and free of that nasty shit like butane. let that sink in. how is that even legal? well news flash it’s legal in the us which is why monat goes off european product standards which is the most strict in the entire world. so next time you need hair product look at the ingredients, shocked? me too! lets get you safe shampoo that improves your hair. as a women, my hair is my baby. as a stylist, hair is my lively hood. i want to give you all the important info no one talks about with your hair. i want to give you a new lease on life and finally tackle your hair probs. hit me up for info on all things hair and how to get in this girl gang. welcome to your new life. all vegan hair products!! monat hair products are literally the best ever i like how actually i noticed the difference from the first wash god still has a purpose for you. god has already set out a plan for you he has your whole life set out for you, attending that job, getting that promotion, that position it might feel great but it’s just a feeling, because i will tell you this much life is not just about that 9-5 job and that’s it. life is more than that there is so much in store for you if you just believed that god is real. i’m glad that god gave me this blessing in disguise to help people change their life. as a little girl i always wanted to help people even in the smallest way i can. the fact that god gave me this chances blows my mind. there are dreams, passions and ideas god wants to place in your heart he’s just waiting on you. you don’t have to be stuck. all you have to do is take a leap of faith. i didn’t know what the outcome would be but i put my all into this opportunity. nothing is more expensive than a missed opportunity in the midst of all of the uncertainty 2020 has brought, i learned that when you change your perspective on how you view things, the things you start looking at change and your dreams become bigger. don’t let other ignorance block your from blessings. “no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no mind has imagined what god has prepared for those who love him.” 1 corinthians 2:9 worked for everything you see baby, come with me, leave all your things yea doubt kills more dreams than failure ever will suzy kassem having second thoughts is normal, but when you make a big decision, remember your why? you will have setbacks and challenges along the way but the lessons you learn will be invaluable for your journey. keep going! don’t let anyone, including yourself or anything get in the way of your dreams! is this heaven or armageddon? i'll be gettin' high with you to watch the endin'.. when you're loving more, caring less. it's the highs and lows with no regrets, oh, we wanted it all then. but we're never running out. we’ll be free spirits when you look at things from a different perspective. life has a new meaning. it’s up to you to dig deep and learn about yourself and others around you in the process. it’s painful yet healing, it’s freedom from a personal prison of fear. let go let god. “don’t give in to your fears. if you do, you won’t be able to talk to your heart.” the alchemist, paulo coelho. we don’t realize just how powerful we really are, we have the ability to think, desire and create. fear holds us back from things we desire most, being afraid of change cripples us into thinking that we must settle and give up on our dreams. life is meant to be lived. to thrive and be happy! show gratitude for what you already have, your hearts desire for more is possible when you surrender yourself to the unknown. the universe will conspire to helping you get what you want. be fearless and trust the process, it’s not easy but it so worth it. it’s your road and yours alone. others may walk with you, but no one can walk it for you rumi here it is, ladies and gents. the secret to how my hair has gone from that, to this swipey these 5 products are my absolute faves and must haves....and i’ve tried just about all of em! if you don’t have these, you’re definitely missin out. btw all of the afters have no filters on them: not sure about the befores because they were taken awhile ago sometimes you just have to pause and take it all in! @monatofficial @cocoprints someone said to me the other day... i don't know how you do it. not sure exactly what is? we all have the same 24 hours in a day... it's really just in how you use them. i try to use them in minutes... every one of them counts. listen... you gotta be able to switch hats throughout the day. i was up till midnight last night with dj helping him with a job application and resume. i was up at 5:30 to get ready and start checking my work emails. during my in-between meetings i met with my contractor. and the list goes on.... what i know is that dj got a call for an interview today, i made the final details on my remodel, i made several vip customers happy and i even think i did a load of laundry!!

how is it possible that i am making more friends social distancing than i did when life was normal? how is it possible that i am making more money after i lost my job then when i was working full-time? this company has been nothing but a blessing to my life and from the bottom of my heart, i am so so grateful. thank you for allowing me to help my clients, help my friends, help myself, and help my family! more focused on where i’m going then who’s not coming these times have brought out so many different emotions and sides of me! hair stylists during this time have taken a major hit! this isn’t just to our business, but to ourselves as artists and as individuals. i started out strong with a positive attitude and fall into days of deep, uneasy anxiety. with school about to start back up and if any of you are single parents trying to live in the bay area, you’ll understand completely! we are all going through things and i pray we are all able to pull through this staying sane and safe!.. today i woke up with a new mindset to turn all these negatives back around like i have before and choose to focus on all of the positives. time to put my health at the forefront again. when you can’t control anything else, choose the things that you can control to dive in full force. monat has been a blessing. it has given me a purpose and a way to stay connected to my clients and also it has brought many new and old faces back into my life! it has made me jump out of comfort zones, open up, and be a leader! it has placed a group of positive, like minded women in my life that i’m extremely thankful for. not to mention all of this comes from a shampoo and skin care company that truly works!.. moral of the story! always find the silver linings. it’s ok to slip and fall, but pull yourself out of that shit in due time and when ur ready of course and take charge of yourself! happy monday! my go to product to protect my hair from the sun reasons to switch your hair care and skin care products. did you know that the us bans only 11 chemicals whereas europe bans 1,500?!? most products can’t pass these standards but monat does! say whaaat! our products are produced using the highest food and pharmaceutical grade botanical extracts, vitamin and minerals, and essential oils. we do not use industrial grade vitamins that are found in most products on the market. this is a anti-aging nutrition system where as most shampoos just clean your hair! our products are never boiled which means that the vitamins and botanical extracts will never lose their nutrients. most companies produce their products in a large stem pressurization vats that boil stocks high temperatures which makes them turn into a liquid or cream state. it’s kinda like boiling your fruits and veggies too long and causing them to lose their nutrients. we use reverse osmosis pharmacopoeia grade water as a base in all of our products which ensures they will not contain, heavy metals, pesticides, or other harmful ingredients that are found in water. the products and more concentrated which means they last longer, and you save money! other products are 60-80 water which means you need to purchase them more often and you’re paying for water! made in the usa, vegan, gluten free, leaping bunny certified, sulfate and paraben free!!! i could go on and on about why are products are so amazing, but these are just a few reasons why you should upgrade your hair and skincare products! stay consistent and trust your vision. “invest in your hair, it is the crown you never take off”- unknown super excited these finally came in. cannot wait to wash my hair 𝑌𝑜𝑢 𝑠𝘩𝑜𝑢𝑙𝑑 𝑘𝑛𝑜𝑤 𝑦𝑜𝑢’𝑟𝑒 𝑏𝑒𝑎𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑓𝑢𝑙 𝑗𝑢𝑠𝑡 𝑡𝘩𝑒 𝑤𝑎𝑦 𝑦𝑜𝑢 𝑎𝑟𝑒 nominada por @valeriavilaa y @ruthvalentina just a mom sitting on a rock, wishing her kid would smile for pictures... i had this grand idea this morning, that i would take levi to the park to take his birthday pictures and then we could play. sounded like a good idea. but let’s just say, things didn’t go as planned. maybe the 3s really are worse than than the 2s i did manage to get a few good ones though swipe through to see the real mood life with toddlers....am i right??

i mean yea of course! but was it for me? i knew i wanted to be a blogger and make money that way... i just didn’t know what steps to take to get there so i pretty much just did nothing and imagined myself as this professional blogger in my mid 20’s. i realized one day that no one is going to do the work for me and it’s not just magically gonna happen because i turn a certain age. i knew i had to create it and make it happen. i had to put in the work. so i started brainstorming. fast forward to march 2020, i took a leap of faith to join a company where i can make money straight from wifi. little did i know it was so much more than that. i get to inspire and motivate people daily. i get to build with a team full of strong, passionate, dedicated people who want to rise and succeed together. i’ve gained true amazing friendships and i’ve learned to be a leader and coach. i also am learning so many useful things for when i do decide to make my blogger dreams com true. if you would’ve asked me in the beginning of this year if i ever would’ve seen myself doing this, i for sure would have said no because i had such judgment around it all. now all i can say is that i wish i joined sooner and i’m beyond greatful for all this company has given me. i can’t wait to see where i’ll be in the beginning of 2021 get to know me and my business partner turned friend. see why we do this business and all we’ve gained from it. some people always ask themselves “but why is shehe so successful?, how did the make it to the top?”.... news flash! success isn’t obtained overnight. you have to show up everyday, put in the work and be consistent. when you master the art of constantly self-regulating your internal environment thoughts, emotions, biases independent of external conditions, then the condition of your mental health will no longer be determined by someone else or something else. hair to die for, skin to live for. in love with my new gear, my comorany is the best never stops surprising me. so proud and blessed to be part of this amazing company. are you ready to slay the week! i thought my dreams were dead. i thought there's no way this is possible for me. have you been there or are you there right now?? it feels like a sign that we’re on the wrong path—that it must mean this isn’t right for us. i was there and it felt so real. but then i realized that whatever massive amounts of resistance i was feeling meant there was an equal level of abundance on the other side. and i was right. listen to my epic story of resistance and resilience in today's bonus podcast episode: my personal story of resistance resilience where i share exactly how much resistance i created when i decided to go all in on being a coach and invested in myself, big time. you'll laugh, you may cry, and you'll see exactly how resistance shows up when we decide to go after our dreams. i can't wait to hear what you think! swipe for a clip from this episode and head to my stories for more and the swipe up link! just as cute as she wanna be. ass shaking sage burning adventurist confident hard working fun having down for whatever issawholevibe high vibrations typa bitch. oh, and this hair is post-walking on the pier at night in the humid florida windy air. which i really love so much. so i’m glad i’ve got the goods to keep my locks pretty frizz free and gorgeous if i do say so myself. did i mention i’m the plant based haircare and skincare plug?

buying food, renting chairs, redecorating my moms backyard for a small and intimate wedding.. little did we expect for covid-19 numbers to rise and almost half of my family sick. the risk was too great.. on july 23rd, we had to cancel all wedding plans again. it's like reliving our worst nightmare. but, i learned from the first time that we must keep moving, stay positive and be grateful for what god has done and blessed us with!

happy monday! here’s a little motivation taking chances is scary. you’re scared of the unknown. scared of failure. scared of what people will say or think. but you know what scares me? missing out on opportunities life gives me because of my fears. for that reason i decided to take a risk and join monat. a team made up of determined girls just like me who are making things happen one day at a time. monat is far more than just washing your hair with wonderful products. to me, monat is a platform to help other girls, to interact with them and assist them in their journey to better hair. it’s giving someone the opportunity to have financial freedom, to work from the comfort of their own home, and to enjoy life and everything it has to offer. it’s a simple conversation that can turn into new friends and new adventures. take the risk and see all you’re truly capable of.

because life is incredibly stressful right now. and, its taken its toll on me... in several ways. this is just one of the visible ways. monat cannot stop stress from triggering an alopecia event. others may not notice, but i do... i've been thinning in my normal spots... stress has always been a major trigger for my alopecia, and this is no different. but what is different, is that i don't have bald spots like i normally would by now. and because i have kept up with my intense repair spray morning and night, i'm seeing regrowth, which normally i would need injections for. so why am i saying all this? because i think it is important for people to hear that there are factors in each of our lives that will help or hinder how these products work. but consistency and not giving up is what will work... in time. monat cannot fix hormonal imbalances, thyroid issues, food sensitivities, stress impacts, etc etc etc! my skin might be a nightmare and my hair might be thinning... but i still stand behind and support these products 10000... and will stay consistent, and this too shall pass. you are not going to believe what’s happening next week and there is no mask needed!!!!!! my amazing friend tracey and i are pulling out “all the stops” to make our mid-summer splash giveaway event epic! i wish i could share all of the surprises and incredible guests we have lined up.....but all i can tell you is that you absolutely will not want to miss this!!! get ready to win some fabulous prizes, learn more about our phenomenal, naturally-based, anti-aging hair and skincare products, and dive into the many outstanding possibilities of the monat business. it is free! no obligation to purchase! we just want you to sit back, relax, and enjoy the beautiful world of monat! $2000 worth of gift cards and prizes given out! including: $300 visa gift card kindle tablet styling tools monat products gift cards monat swag spartina 449 handbag and much more all you have to do is comment below “i’m in”! just do it!!! i look forward to having a great time with you!!! tue, july 28th thu, july 30th for more details, go to https:www.facebook.comgroups477344443138552?refshare “that’s why her hair is so big. it’s full of secrets!” except i don’t hold back any secrets, especially when it comes to my hair! ️this is day three hair after washing with my volumizing shampoo and conditioner. i blow dried it wednesday night, straightened it and touched it up thursday and friday, and curled it on saturday morning. ️products used to blow dry: rejuvabeads to mend split ends, frizz fix primer, and the blow out cream products used to curl: dry shampoo, leave in conditioner on my ends, refinish hair spray obsessed with the fact that i can use these products without my hair being weighed down, they’re all natural, and they literally improve your hair the more you use them they’re anti aging products for your hair! these are just some of the products i have s w o r nby for the last 2.5 years. if you’re ready to have the best hair of your life, let’s chat i can give you a personalized product recommendation for your hair goals! today is the last day to grab our flexible hold hair gel for only $10 when you spend $72 counts towards vip enrollment! it ends at midnight and it will most likely sell out! ay yo! is your facebook optimized for sales?

there are little to no companies that make a shampoo and conditioner for red heads-because we don’t need it. when i was young, i can’t tell you how many people told me never to dye my hair. when i worked at tim hortons a man came in for a cup of coffee, he said, “did you know that 2 million dollars are spent on red hair dye every year, but only 12 of the population is a natural red head?”. i can’t tell you if what he said is true, it was also over 10 years ago so i’m sure those numbers are different now. but, it made me realize that i am different and that is okay. during my high school years i encountered the share of comments...kick a ginger day, you have no soul...blah blah blah. but the comment i remember so clearly, was when i was told that because i stand out, i am weird. well, that day i made that person view it a different way. i’m weird because i’m one of a few? well, your weird because you are one of many. not that there is anything wrong with brunettes or blondes...but that particular boy needed to be put in his place along with strawberry blonde hair, i have fair skin and a large amount of freckles my collection becomes more abundant every time i’m in the sun. i am the complete package of a ginger, and i can honestly say i wouldn’t change a thing.⁣⁣ be yourself- no matter your hair colour⁣⁣ don’t let someone tell you that you aren’t beautiful or pretty⁣⁣ we have our off days, bad hair days, bad skin days eczema and that is ok ⁣⁣don’t let others decide your confidence don’t take one thing you heard be all that you hear for the rest of your life yes, i had my sister do a photo shoot of me. so what? choosing to be positive and have a grateful attitude is going to determine how you’re going to live your life me: “mom get a good angle of my cake” mom: “the wind is making your toppings fall well we tried our best. i’ve never been one to like cooking yet i learned how to make this with my mom during high school to fundraise for my college expenses. p.s. it doesn’t require any heat so it’s awesome! introducing my “rosca vegetariana” made of cucumbers, jicama, carrots, gummy bears, fritos and chamoy. all signs point to oily hair! this is going on 8th day with no washing. is that gross?

that's right, it's been 4 years since i started my journey with my company and i have to say it's been the best 4 years ever!! i have learned and grown so much over these past few years i have earned friendships and family that i honestly didn't know i needed. i have gone on trips, found a new passion in life and learned some amazing skills!! i found what was lacking in my life and i did not even know there was a void, but when it was filled i felt whole again. i have rekindled my relationship with my husband, gotten closer with my children, become grateful and thankful to god for all he has done for me and so much more!! you see, when it all comes down to it, this journey saved me. i didn't understand what it was like to love myself, i was damaged goods and didn't feel worthy of greatness or anything!! since being a part of this company, i have gained so much courage and self worth. i have found out that i wasn't broken, but that i was even more valuable with the scars that i have and i carry with me. i have learned that my past does not define me and no matter what, i am a survivor and that i am worthy and enough!! when you see me post about my makeup, you're probably thinking, oh lord here's another one of those 'things' that someone is doing!! to you it may be a thing, but to me it changed my life. granted, it's not for everyone, but i can tell you this. if you want to know what true success is, what true passion and service is, what a community of upstanding women and men is like....then i'd suggest you get with me and let me give you the down low on this!!

my teenage years consisted of bad haircuts and microscopic eyebrows. to say i fit in well would be a lie. fast forward twenty years, that feeling continued. as a military spouse who moves frequently, i have often felt like “the new girl”. i’ve seen friend circles come and go. i’ve witnessed women act like children to each other. i’ve experienced low self-esteem and even depression, at times. then i found my tribe: women who encourage me to be weird myself. women who motivate me to do my best. women who uplift me when i doubt myself. women who empower me to live out my dreams. women who validate my feelings and support my ideas. i thank god every single day for this blessing. it is so much more than just makeup. mama, if you‘re still feeling like the new girl, please know there is always a seat at our table. happy friday you all!

well, if you have no problem with your make-up staying on all day and you are happy with the texture of your skinpores then the answer may be no. it is not necessary for everyone, but if you would like to reduce the appearance of pores or mattify oily skin then primer may be the answer you have been looking for. for oilycombination skin opt for a mattifying primer. for dry or blemish prone skin hydrating primer which is water based is a great choice. for enlarged pores choose a silicone based primer. i love primer to help my foundation glide on seamlessly and even out my skin prior to application, contact me for further information if you would like to know more... make-up natural by younique rimel epic waterproof delineador black rubor sweet bb flawless honey primer mate...... labial cremoso <3 i feel like this is one of those glow up pictures, when in actuality it was the same day. this makeup is woke up early, jumped on the bike for a little wake up exercise and then made my face pretty for the day. i always feel more alive when i have my makeup done!

i just got out of shower and it’s mask day! i used the exfoliating mask first that it’s good for removing the dirt, oil and the dead skin, then as you can see the perfecting mask that it’s good for nourish, condition and bubbles to absorb toxin release oxygen back to your skin. if you have a lot issues with acnes and blemishes the perfecting mask is a most for you! just remember friends, if you likelove makeup, your makeup is only going to look good if your skin looks good! masks are so important and should be a part of your skin care regime. if you don’t have one pm me and i can give you a recommendation. can you shed some light on something for me? i believe you can’t have success without failure, and this has definitely been true in my life. for example, i ran for status advancement in my business three different times before i reached it. i won’t ever view the first two tries as failure. i view them as opportunities to learn from what didn’t work. i have always been fascinated by other people’s stories and wonder whether or not they have the same beliefs. shed some light for me, friend: do you believe in this age-old saying? kinda sunday monday mood. how is your monday going?? stiff upper lip lip stain in suckerpunched one of the makeup looks i have done with my younique makeup, look at those lashes still have i told you lately how much i love my mascara?!

a side hustle may not make you rich although it can. a side hustle can help you grow on the inside, which spills out to the outside. sometimes the growth includes material things or freedoms you lacked: travel, time, money, the means to give to others things a lot of people want. but that growth can also include things you can’t see. confidence, abundance mindset, leadership skills, positivity, and completely changing the way you talk to yourself. i wish there were more people out there who realized they could create more in their life with a side hustle. instead, a lot choose to stay where they are and complain about it. they don’t really want solutions. they don’t want to do anything to “fix” their problems. they want to complain and get sympathy or pity or whatever. but the ones who are actually willing to put in the work, even if they’re scared? those people are my people. if you’ve thought about doing what i do or want to know more, just say hey and i’ll send ya some info and you can decide if it’s right for you!

true or false: running is bad for your knees? the answer: false! i was surprised, too! researchers have found that the more people ran, the less likely they were to develop knee problems! so in fact, may actually help your joints rather than hurt them. if you do happen to feel knee pain, it’s probably due to overtraining or poor form. what i am loving about this running program i am doing is the trainer! she is so sweet and supportive and i am learning so much about running. like, who knew there was so much to it?! not me! overall, i've been feeling fairly good and am accomplishing more with each workout. my knees haven't really been bothering me, but my calves and shins have been super tight! we have some amazing stretching workouts...and i've been using them all! so, let me know what you do to keep your calves and shins from tightening up! also, if you'd like to learn more about this running program i am doing, my inbox is open! i'm currently getting clients set up for my november wellness group! perfect time to join us! dm me for more details! are you so comfortable in your life that you're afraid to make any changes? are you truly happy? are you afraid of failing? yeah girl, i feel that! i think back not too long ago. from the outside, it appeared that i had the perfect life. you know the job, the house, the husband, the friends, the travel. and i was comfortable. but i learned that i wasn't really happy. in fact, i hadn't been happy for a long time. in fact inside i was really sad. it would be a lie to say that the first step to making changes wasn't without fear. but the fact of the matter is that once i took that first step, the rest of the steps started falling into place. looking back, could i or should i have done things differently? most likely, yes. but at this point in time, it is what it is. can't change that. but i am grateful for where it has brought me. so i guess what i'm saying is sometimes even though you may be comfortable...you'll never really know what's out there unless you try something different...and get uncomfortable! so what’s holding you back? just sitting here reflecting on my recent trip to missouri. not going to lie it was a busy vacation. one of those where you're just constantly on the go, not so much relaxing... and the drive? wow! 10 hours each way and driving through crazy hillsmountains? that was very much anxiety producing for me! but the one thing i found was that the state of missouri has their priorities in the right places. you may not agree with me, but i found it so refreshing to visit a place where god and country were very much their top priorities! there wasn't a single show that we saw that didn't celebrate america as a country. that didn't salute our veterans for their service. that didn't incorporate god through their speech or music. even our hotel had christian music piped through the speakers. my mom and i were literally brought to tears on a daily basis. just feeling the support, the community, and the connection to complete strangers. i get it. this may not be for everyone. and i am completely ok with that. but for me? it was refreshing. i have not felt more connected to other human beings in months! we really are a great country. there really is still good in this world. there is hope. it's completely ok to disagree with me. but for my soul? it's exactly what i needed. how are you taking care of yourself and finding the good? i am drowning! anyone else feel that way lately? coming back from vacation i should feel really refreshed... which my soul is! but man, i am tired! today was day 3 of 6 work days in a row. 1 night on call and one more tomorrow. two meetings two nights in a row. and i’m running my free live challenge daily this week! whew! nothing like going all in! i can tell you this! the minute i wake up, i’m already looking forward to when i go to bed! but the reality is life is tough especially right now. and it’s ok to not be ok sometimes. you’ve survived everything you’ve been through before. and you’ll get through this too! so hang in there. you’ve got this! i believe in you!! this week i've been running my first, independent, free challenge group! for a long time i've relied on my team or other coaches to run a free group with me. it would be lie if i said it didn't completely scare the crap out of me to go out on my own! but you know what? i'm doing it. and it feels good! it may not be perfect. but i am learning. and i can only improve from here! being an independent business owner isn't an easy job. but it is so worth it! i absolutely love the fact that i can make it my own! and change things up whenever i want. it is 100 mine. no one else's. so you continue to do you...and i'll continue to do me. that's the beauty of free enterprise! if you’d like to join my free learning community, let me know and i’ll get you the link to the group! and, next week we will be hosting a try coaching for a week for free! let me know if this is something that remotely interests you! would love to have you come and see what this is all about and how you could make if your own! it is not uncommon to feel unhappy or unsatisfied at different times in our lives. and when that happens, we often tend to blame our circumstances. only if...this or that hadn't have happened...then i'd be happy. only if...that person would have done this or that...then i'd be happy only if...then i'd be satisfied. only if...then i'd feel whole. only if...then i'd be in a better place. i'm here to tell you there's one common denominator to all these stories...and that is you! so often we are too busy blaming our circumstances that we either refuse to believe or just blatantly deny that the problem could lie within ourselves. yes, there are definitely things in life that we can't control. but that being said, we can always choose how we respond to them... and that different way of thinking can definitely lead us to a better place. so next time you find yourself blaming others, or blaming your circumstances, i encourage you to look within. needing help trying to understand how to make this shift? i will tell you this...for me, personal development was the key. what do i mean by that? learning and growing...every.damn.day! want some of my top reads? drop a book in the comments! anxiety! such an awful feeling! anxiety is something that i've dealt with for quite awhile. having just gotten back from vacation after a week away, the anxiety of returning to work had been creeping in full force today! although i love traveling and i love being away from it all, there's something about having to face work again that always throws me into a horrible state of anxiety! i know that my patient's were well taken care of when i was away. i don't doubt that one bit because i love my team! but i always kind of feel punished for having taken time off. you know what i mean? it's like you come back to work and get the crap schedule for the week. like you get completely dumped on because you took time off. i know it will all be fine. it always is. but it doesn't make my anxiety any worse about the whole situation! i can't wait for the day that i have more freedom in my schedule. until i can actually dictate my own schedule. you see, i have some big dreams! and one of those dreams? not working for someone else. working for myself, on my time. getting rid of all that post-vacation anxiety...for good! anyone else get anxious about returning to work after time off? double tap if you agree! i honestly just have to laugh at how life works sometimes... just less than 2 years ago, i traveled to new orleans on vacation. a few months later, they announced our yearly coaching event would be held in new orleans. of course that in person event didn't happen this year. but at our virtual event, they announced our yearly coaching event next year will be in st. louis, missouri. now as i just returned from missouri on vacation albeit on the opposite side of the state...i’m already dreaming about next year when i will be back in this state. i have absolutely been craving our community...because these events light you up like nothing i have ever experienced! i can't help but be filled with excitement! see you next year missouri! if you want to join me in st. louis next year...we'd love to have you! let's chat! we live in a microwave society with crockpot dreams. have you heard that one before? we are so often looking for that instant gratification. but the truth of the matter is...that's often not how life works. our dreams, our visions, our goals...they all take time! so just because you're not seeing instant results. just because you tried once and didn't get what you were looking for...don't stop! continue to let those dreams and goals simmer. continue to check in on a regular basis. and days, weeks, months or even years from now, if you keep at it...that crockpot will reward you with exactly what it is you were working so hard for! double tap if you're pursuing your crockpot dreams! vacation for me used to mean laziness! time to unplug...relax...do nothing other than what made my soul happy. after all, i felt i deserved it! and while that's still somewhat true...it has definitely changed a bit. i've found i've become much more active during my vacations. i've found that i even look at the fitness amenities...who is this person?... being that i stream all my workouts...i can literally do them anywhere! and i have! a hotel room in new orleans, la...check. a hotel room in san juan capistrano, ca...check. a hotel lawn in iowa city, ia...check. a lake resort in northern mn...check. a friend's apartment in nashville, tn...check. a beach in belize...check. intentionally moving my body every day has provided me with so many positive things...the greatest of which is hands down my mental health. yes, even on vacation! why? because i know i am a better person for it! and now i can add a hotel room in branson, mo to the list! do you work out while on vacation? coaching is not necessarily an easy job. it takes time. it takes work. it takes perseverance. however, the fact that i can do it from literally anywhere? that is easy! no being tied to an office. no being tied to home. no being tied to anything! so here i am...on vacation...getting some work done! not because i have to...but because i can! you see, when you find something that lights your soul on fire? it doesn't really feel like work... i love it! sound like something you might be interested in? join me tomorrow night to see if this coaching thing is right for you! whoop! whoop! guess who is excited for our newest program that launched today? yep! this girl! be right back...gonna run grab it right now! it is a strengthening and running program. with the ultimate goal of running a 5k in just 21 days! don't get me wrong...i am not a runner. never have been. i think back to when i actually participated in sports...back in the 8th or 9th grade of school. the first week of practice and having to run a mile to start our hours long practices... hated it! but i'm going to give this new program a go because i've heard so many positive things about it! my official start date will by the 12th. would love to have you join me! want to try it out? i've got a free sample workout for you to try! dm me for the link! the photo on the left popped up on my facebook memories the other day celebrating oktoberfest. i think i failed at trying to recreate it! but wanted a similar picture for comparison! the girl on the left was in a word, exhausted. i remember seeing other women my age going about their lives and seeming so alive and wondering how they did it? why did i always feel so sick and tired??? well, it may have been related to my crappy thyroid...but i knew there was more. i look back at pictures like this that pop up in my memories on social media and i don't even recognize that girl anymore. i never realized i had let myself go that much! and then it happened.... one day i was at the doctor's office and it was brought to my attention that technically i was in the obese category. like wait, what? and what happened next? life changing! i had been following my coworkers wellness journey on social media. and i drew my line in the sand. enough was enough. with her mentorship, i made the switch and it wasn’t even a little easy! bad habits really do die hard! and they still like to pop up once in awhile! but the girl on the right is sooo thankful the one on the left didn’t give up! this kind of freedom is worth it all and more! looking for help reaching your own goals? i'm here for you! start by joining my free community! message me for the link! prove me wrong...⠀ running is hard! but sometimes the toughest things provide the best return on investment! running keeps you healthier physically, emotionally and mentally!⠀ it can make you feel happy! running releases happy chemicals like serotonin in your brain, elevating your mood. it can make your body stronger! to run we must be able to support our body weight with our legs the force of our weight trains our muscles and bones to become stronger. it can burn calories! running spends crazy calories. especially during marathons! the more energy you spend, the more calories you burn, and the more strong and fit you become. i have a whole list of the benefits of running! want it? drop me an emoji and i'll shoot it over to you! did you know??? october is breast cancer awareness month! about 1 in 8 women in the united states will develop breast cancer at some point in her lifetime. for as much research as has been done, we still haven’t been able to find a cure. this is the time when people wear a little extra pink to spread awareness. let’s kick off the month by posting a pretty in pink picture in the comments below! once you share your picture in the comments, share this post to spread awareness and make our home pages a little more pink! i know nutrition is something that a lot of people really struggle with. been there, done that...and still struggle sometimes. the one thing i've found to be the most helpful is to plan! some people i know are really good at meal prepping...essentially cooking all your meals for the week in a single day. mind blowing in my opinion! although i don't necessarily cook all my meals in one day, i do try to plan them out for the week. totally takes the guess work out of the whole what's for dinner conundrum and definitely lessens the chance you'll just grab take out or throw a pizza in the oven or hit up the drive thru! find some healthy recipes that you enjoy and grocery shop accordingly. a lot less waste that way as well! i also like to keep things simple! a bag of frozen vegetables and a chicken breast? instant stir fry! a bag of shredded cabbage and some italian sausage? instant egg roll in a bowl! frozen cauliflower rice and a couple eggs? instant fried rice! if nothing else, a huge, tasty salad! don't make it more difficult than it has to be! oh, and i always make enough for at least 2 meals! leftovers are kind of a big deal in my world! i set a lot of big goals for myself this month.⠀ and you know what? i don't think i've hit a single one of them!⠀ most people would be quite discouraged by that...and trust me, that's completely normal.⠀ it actually takes a lot of effort to not feel like that!⠀ but if i've learned anything in life, dreaming big is better than not dreaming at all. and when you dream big, you won't always succeed on the first try. maybe not even on the second, third, or fourth try. but you just keep going!⠀ why? because i truly believe that if it's meant to be...it will happen. maybe just not on your time...⠀ as for this month, i will allow myself to feel disappointed for a hot minute...not much longer. i will dust myself off and i will try again!⠀ i believe in you. i believe in me. keep dreaming big my friends!⠀ if you’re ready to crush some goals this month, my october wellness group is opening soon! let’s chat! the mind is a very powerful thing. not only do our brains control our basic bodily functions that sustain life, all of our thoughts are also produced there. some days it may feel as though your brain is short-circuiting...like literally you can't remember things, the only things you think are negative, etc. but you know what i think is the coolest part about our brains? they are ever evolving! i promise you...you have the power to change how you think! you are in complete control over which information you choose to put into your brain...including how you speak to yourself, how you handle your emotions, etc.! that's pretty freaking amazing! so if you're stuck in a rut with the same old thought processes...pick up a personal development book. read it. then read it again. and really implement what they are telling you. then pick up another one and do the same. you'll be surprised how much you can improve your mindset in a very short amount of time. try it sometime...you just might agree with me! day 16 of the 21 day program that i am currently doing. i am always looking ahead to what i may do next and this time i'm kind of unsure! i have absolutely loved this program and will definitely do it again in the future but there is also a new program coming out that has me intrigued. it is a running program...something i never would have considered doing in the past! what i love about it most is that it's a cross training program. so each day there is weight training portion and a running portion. the ultimate goal is that everyone who completes the program will run a 5k on their last day! i've heard from other's who have completed this program already that it is great for people who are new to running and for those who already run improving strength, stamina and time! they've all had some pretty amazing results physically as well literally running off the inches and pounds! i have some reasons for not wanting to try this program...but they're really just excuses. excuses that i know i can overcome! so if i'm going to go all in with this, i'm definitely going to look for others to do it with me! if this is something that speaks to you, let's chat! wishing you a day as sunny as your smile... as warm as your heart... a day as wonderful as you are! happy birthday momma! accountability is key to most everything in life. you are responsible for so many things on a daily basis. when it comes to your own health, fitness, etc., you still have to be responsible for your own journey. but what i've found is that surrounding yourself with like minded people who have similar goals makes a big difference! my monthly wellness groups provide just that. a group of like minded women who are also on their own wellness journeys. showing up on a daily basis for themselves. all while supporting the other women who are also showing up! being a coach has definitely helped to keep me accountable. i mean who is really going to believe that i can help them...if i don't show up consistently on my own journey?! right? the fact of the matter is that nobody can show up for you. you still have to show up and put in the work...but knowing that others are going to cheer you on each and every day? that's pretty cool. september is already coming to an end. my new group will be starting october 1st and there is room for you to join us! let's chat! there is no way in the world that i ever thought i would take on a second job! i already work full time as a nurse which also includes weekends and holidays...and add on call 1-2 nights a week and it becomes much more than full time! but a couple years ago i started a wellness journey that has changed my life more than i would have ever imagined. of course there's been positive changes with my body, but more than that, these positive changes have also spread to other areas of my life. and that's why i felt called to help others do the same. the best part about it? i can do it on my time. i don't have to punch a clock or answer to anyone else. i can work my coaching business in my little pockets of time first thing in the morning, over my lunch break if i get one, after work, after dinner. that's the beauty of it all. i get to work it into my schedule, when it works for me and my life. if you're curious about learning more about what it is i do as a coach, or how you could join my team and build your own business, i've got a couple pretty amazing opportunities for you to learn more coming up this week! join us and see if it would be a good fit for you, no strings attached! let's chat! if happiness, courage, bravery, inner peace, etc come naturally to you...congrats! i think that is something we all strive for. but for some of us it takes work. whether it be a pod cast, an audio book, or a real book...there is literally something out there for anything you may be struggling with. it doesn’t mean you’re weak. in fact i would say just the opposite. the thought of you wanting to improve yourself is something only a strong person does. you’re never too old to learn. you’re never too old to grow. you’re never too old to make positive changes in your life. do you read self improvement books? drop your favorites below! transformation can be such a beautiful thing! but when it comes to health and wellness it isn't always obvious! some people focus on the numbers...the number on the scale, the inches, the calories. i'm here to tell you to stop! while those numbers can be important...they are just tools to help us measure where we've been and where we're going. so if you're not seeing the numbers that you want to see. step back for a hot minute. take a peek at where you were and where you are going. reevaluate what you are doing to get yourself there. make some adjustments and move forward! consistency is key. as long as you stay consistent, the numbers will come. if you're feeling stuck or looking for something different...let me know! i'd be happy to help you learn about what it is that i do to stay consistent. how i use the tools i've learned to keep me on track. and most of all what it is i've done to change my life...and how i can help you change yours! fall is just around the corner and it’s definitely been feeling like it here where i live! a change in seasons can be stressful when it comes to our clothes... am i right? do you dread putting on a bathing suit for the first time in the springsummer? are you worried about trying to fit into your jeans this fall? i remember many years that i’d literally have to buy a new wardrobe for each season. no more! thanks to the intuitive nutrition program i follow i can say that for the last two years i haven’t had to do that! ok. that’s actually a little fib. i actually had to buy smaller clothes about two years ago. but that i didn’t mind! are you worried about fitting into your jeans this fall? it’s not too late! let’s chat! the kids have been back to school for a week, or two, or more! or maybe they’re still at home, distance learning... and they’re eating all the junk! either way...are you already running out of healthy snack ideas? don’t worry! it’s not just all the veggies...although they’re included too!! i’ve still got you covered! muffins, brownies, cookies? yes!! just healthy alternatives! head on up to my bio and download your free copy of my 15 back to school snacks your kids are guaranteed to love! not going to lie...the adults will love them too! grab them now! happy grandparent's day!! it's been years since i've been able to say that! growing up i only ever met 3 grandparents...2 great grandmas and 1 grandma. the others were all gone before i came into the world...and by the age of 24, those i did meet were gone too! so if you're lucky enough to still have a grandparent in your life...i hope you took a moment to celebrate them today! in loving memory...grandma marge. it's definitely been starting to feel more like fall over the last few weeks! seriously one of my favorite seasons! i love being able to open the windows up and get some fresh air... i love snuggling up under a blanket on a crisp, cool evening... i love changing my outfit 5 times a day to keep up with the temperature changes... i love the changing of the leaf colors... definitely time to start decorating!! have you decorated for fall yet? september 11, 2001 a day few of us will ever forget. i've seen so many posts today that honor and remember those who lost their lives that day while trying to save others. yes! by all means! they were true heroes! but one post that really struck me actually talked about september 12, 2001... remember that day? although we were all still in shock and grieving...something else was taking place. the people of this country were coming together. with all that has happened in 2020...it is time. it is time that we come together again as a nation. as decent freaking human beings. no matter ones political party affiliation, race, sexuality, gender, religion or whatever makes us “different” from each other. be humble. be kind. be love. one objection that i often get when inviting others to start their wellness journey is that it costs too much... what i hear, however, is i'm not worth it. why do i say that? because you can literally jump start your wellness journey with me... ...for less money than your monthly cable bill. ...for less than your monthly cell phone bill. ...for less than a large coffee at your favorite coffee shop on the daily. don't get me wrong...i get it...it has definitely been a hard year for a lot of people financially. and maybe it costs too much is a fact for you. but if this whole virus situation has taught me anything... 1. your health should be a priority. 2. it's time we get back to the basics and focus on what is important. the point is...if you want it bad enough, you'll make it work! what could you sacrifice in the short term...in order to make long term gains in your life? are you worth it? i think so! let's chat! my heart is full! it's been far too long! i have not been able to make it to a single auxiliary meeting this summer! although i can't say enough about the online communities that i belong to, being a part of a local group that can actually get together irl these days is something that i've been greatly missing! hopefully one of these days we'll be able to get back to serving the community at public events...but until then we're coming up with innovative ideas to continue to serve our veterans and our community! we are currently collecting for our sock drive for veterans! unfortunately due to the current situation, we are only accepting cash donations...which we will then purchase socks with. if you're interested in donating to support a good cause, let me know! i'll send you the venmo link! my team and i are so excited to announce our next free group focus your mornings. this seriously could not come at a better time! so many people heading back to work after being home for months. kids going back to school...either online or in person. and really, just so much other life stuff that has thrown us out of our routines in the last few months. i know my morning routine has definitely suffered in the last few months! if you're looking at getting back into a good morning routine or even just leveling up your morning routine...this is for you! join us for great tips and tricks to start your days off on the right note! we will officially start 𝙣𝙚𝙭𝙩 monday 914...and like i said already, it's free! you literally have nothing to lose...unless you chose not to join us! message me to get added to the group! happy labor day friends! defined by the department of labor as a yearly, national tribute to the contributions workers have made to the strength, prosperity, and well-being of our country. all though i worked as a nurse this weekend, today is my day off. but that doesn't mean that i'm not actually working! does that even make sense? yes! my days off from my nursing job are the days i really pour into my coaching business! not going to lie though, it really doesn't even feel like working! both of these jobs focus on helping others with tough stuff...but are so very rewarding! it just so happens that my team is hosting a sneak peek into coaching that starts this wednesday 99! if you're the slightest bit interested in what this coaching stuff is all about and how you could be the ceo of your own business, let me know and i'll get you the link to join us! would love to have you come and learn...no strings attached! back to day 1 tomorrow! after a small surgical procedure on my back 3 weeks ago i'm ready to get back to work! working out that is! i feel like my body has had enough time to heal and i'm looking forward to picking up some weights again! i have to say i'm just a little bit anxious...kind of feeling like all those kids going back to school...that was always a hard day for me! but i know that my body is capable of amazing things...and i've got this! maybe you're also getting ready to start something new in the coming days too?! i feel ya! that's one thing i love about my monthly wellness clubs. it's definitely a safe, supportive community in which we can share all of our struggles or anxieties, our wins or losses... if you're looking for a community of supportive, strong, women...let's chat and see if it would be a good fit for you! being a nurse is not an easy job...i think most people would agree. but then tell them you work in hospice? whoa! it’s like a whole new ball game! i hear all the time...”that must be so difficult”... it can be. but more than anything it’s so rewarding! being entrusted to care for someone as they make their final passage is the biggest honor i’ve ever had. and if you have faith...you know there is something better that awaits! the biggest thing i’ve learned working in hospice doesn’t even have to do with being a nurse or even dying. but instead about living! life is short my friends. live your life! do the hard things. do the scary things. do the crazy things. i had a patient recently say to me “i thought they called these the golden years...”. that’s what we are lead to believe...right? but there are no guarantees in life. so quit waiting for the right time... so quit making the excuses... so quit letting anyone or anything hold you back... tomorrow is not promised to any of us. we are all just one decision, one diagnosis, one accident always from the end. every day that we live is one day closer to our own death. so get out there and live your life! no regrets! happy holiday weekend! when i think of labor day weekend, i think of family, friends, barbecues, fires...all the good stuff! unfortunately...i'll be working this weekend...but i can't wait to see what all of you are up to! looking for last minute bbq ideas? don't forget to head over to my bio to grab your free copy of some of my favorite bbq recipes! hope you all have a safe, happy and healthy weekend! enjoy! sometimes it's difficult to see how far we've come...unless there's proof! although i still have a ways to go on my own journey, i love looking back as my pictures from the last two years...because the proof is there! when i look at the girl on the left, i see: someone looks sad. someone who looks tired. someone who looks like she has no confidence. someone who looks scared. someone who looks defeated. when i look at the girl on the right, i see: someone with glowing eyes that looks well rested. someone with a bright smile that looks genuine. someone with posture that exudes confidence. someone who looks like she can accomplish anything. i am so happy that my coach encouraged me to take pictures...trust me, it is not something that i wanted to do! so even though it may be hard to take those pictures because you're not yet where you want to be...do it anyway! you can always delete them later...but you can never go back and take them... a month from now, a year from now, five years from now...you'll be happy you did! i seriously look back at the last year and a half of my life and can not believe where i am today! i am so thankful that i took a chance...that i reached out to my coworker who i saw changing her life if such a positive way. i am so thankful that i believed in myself...that i finally realized that i was worth more! i am so thankful that i found a better way to live...that i chose to change my lifestyle. i am so thankful that i found a supportive group of women...that i can truly connect with that have similar goals. the old me never would have gone for a 2 mile walk after work...or at all! the old me never would have reached out to people to make new friends. the old me would have been content with what i had...yet wouldn’t have been happy. if you’re looking for more, i challenge you to take a chance...on yourself!! you never know what your capable of unless you actually try! my september wellness group will be starting soon and i have a spot reserved just for you! trust me, i still have a lot of big dreams and goals...and i’ll be there with you every step of the way! let’s chat! everything i’ve ever wanted has almost always been waiting on the other side of fear. fear that i didn’t have what it took. that i couldn’t make the time. that i would fail or couldn’t afford the risk. that i would be rejected. one day i finally realized that growing up meant i had to make a choice: would i keep letting fear direct my entire life, then one day look back and wonder about the what-ifs? or would i rather look back with zero questions, knowing i’d turned over every stone? for me, there was no more guessing. what about you? although today was different than what most would expect for a wedding...i’m not sure they would have wanted it any other way! it was what it was. zoom from the parking lot... social distanced reception...if only for a short time! it was warm today! we know the actual celebration will come soon enough. but today, one thing remains the same... love is patient, love is kind. it does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. it does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. it always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. love never fails. 1 corinthians 13 congratulations to my big brother and his beautiful bride! welcome to our crazy family! i am humbled. i had a “minor” surgical procedure on monday and it hasn’t affected my life so “minor”ly! it’s amazing how many habits we have that we aren’t even aware of! how we sleep... how we put on or take off a shirt... how we shower... how we put on our socks and shoes... how we put on our seat belt... how we tie our masks! the location of my incision makes it extremely difficult to navigate everyday tasks! not only that, doctors orders say i can not work out. i can not lift 10 lbs or more. my dressing must stay on for 1-2 weeks pressure dressing was off at the 48 hour mark!. i seriously could have never imagined having an issue with being told i need to “lay low” essentially. but my goodness! i have definitely missed the “normalcy” of life including my daily home workouts! i have the go ahead to start walking. so hopefully the weather cooperates and i can get on the trail tomorrow! in the meantime i’m trying to allow myself time and grace to allow my body to heal fully! stay strong my friends! and thank you all for your well wishes! “negative and difficult things happen to all of us; most of them are mostly or completely out of our control. it’s how we react, how we view those circumstances and conditions, that makes the difference between success and failure and that is completely within our control.” -jeff olson, the slight edge one of the best books i've ever read. how do you react to your circumstances and conditions? one of the biggest game-changers i’ve learned on my journey that affected all aspects of my life was the importance of continuing to take steps forward...even if the pace fluctuates. that it’s not about maintaining a certain speed…it’s the direction i’m going, and even more importantly, whether i’m still moving. trip-ups will come… and accepting that truth was the most freeing things i could have done!! it’s not about living in fear of them- it’s about what we do as soon as it happens, because they will. stay strong my friends...keep putting one foot in front of the other. you're going places...and i believe in you! nutrition fact if you drink a gallon of water a day, you won't have time for other people's drama because you'll be too busy going to the bathroom! more water for me, please…!!! stay hydrated my friends! if you’ve been following me for a bit, you’ve probably seen that i love to live a healthy lifestyle, that i have fitness goals, and i work my coaching business from home! yes, i get paid to share my healthy lifestyle on my social media! i get earn trips to warm, sunny places to hang with girlfriends and learn more! i help others get their groove back and achieve consistent, lifelong success! if you’d had more questions or ever wondered if you could do what i do!, you can totally ask all the things! even better...you can preview what this job is like!! if you'd feel even more excited knowing you'll be mentored every step of the way...this is definitely for you! i am currently opening 5 spots for my coaching mentorship! join my team tomorrow night to learn more about what it is that i do! drop an emoji in the comments if you wanna check it out! 𝙄𝙩’𝙨 𝙙𝙚𝙛𝙞𝙣𝙞𝙩𝙚𝙡𝙮 𝙖 𝙡𝙤𝙫𝙚𝙝𝙖𝙩𝙚 𝙧𝙚𝙡𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣𝙨𝙝𝙞𝙥 𝙄 𝙝𝙖𝙫𝙚 𝙜𝙤𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙤𝙣 𝙝𝙚𝙧𝙚! who would have thought i would have been excited to go to the dentist?! i was scheduled to go the beginning of may...but covid had different plans! definitely not my favorite thing to do on a day off...but after almost 10 months it was time! what is one thing that you've missed that you never thought you would over the last few months? 21 days! it hasn't always been easy. in fact, i've been challenged in new ways every day! and let's just say i'm glad we used cordless jump ropes...otherwise i probably would have ended up on my face a few times! i have been sore in places i typically don't feel sore following my workouts. but it feels so good to know my body is changing! in the past 21 days i haven't missed a workout. i've been reining in my nutrition...because that is what drives results! i may have only lost 12 of a pound. but i'm o.k. with that! why? because i have also lost 3 inches! 1 whole inch just from around my waist! and look at that shoulder definition! i'm not going to lie...i am a little disappointed with my numbers. but you know what? that's o.k. too! why? because i've pushed myself harder than i thought i could at times! because i smiled through the cardio...every day! because i'm stronger! because i'm more confident! because my muscles are more toned! and most of all...i am grateful! grateful for access to these amazing super trainers! grateful for this 39 year old body that shows up and gets it done every single day. grateful for this community of like minded women who help to hold me accountable. will be starting round 2 soon! are you in or are you out? summer’s holding on but is almost over! what better way to spend your last days of soaking it up in the sun than with a bbq party?! bbq’s offer an endless variety of flavors-- from smoked, to savory, to sweet! you can choose from a wide range of proteins. not to mention veggies taste delicious smoked over an open fire! but did you know that grilling your food is one of the healthiest ways to cook??? yeah, it’s true! i couldn’t believe it either. but the more i thought about it, the more it made sense! consider this... when you grill something you generally don’t coat your food in batter-- normally it’s a light marinade or sauce. this makes your grilled lemon chicken a lot healthier than fried wings. there’s also the fact that as your food cooks, most of the fat coming off of it falls to the bottom of the grill instead of soaking your meat in grease. this can take a whopping amount of calories off your meal! there are numerous other benefits to having a bbq-- one of the biggest being that it’s outside! you can enjoy the fresh air and sunshine while you cook! you can even find a good way to social distance with friends and family outside while hanging out around the grill. not only are bbq’s healthy and delicious-- they bring people together. that’s why i’ve compiled 12 of the most mouthwatering bbq recipes just for you! link is in my bio! drop your email and i'll send it right over! eating clean and staying fit does not have to be expensive! i get it… less healthy food is cheaper in the short term... but when we get real with ourselves on where we’re investing our money, the solution becomes pretty clear. are we eating out? cha-ching! are we buying alcohol, soda or coffee? cha-ching! are we buying snack foods? chips? cookies? anything sugary? cha-ching! if we have specific fitness goals, we need accountability or some form of direction to get there… so gyms, classes, fancy organic meals and personal trainers seem to be our options! cha-ching! did you know that the amount of money most people spend on those things in a year is more than enough to cover home gym equipment, a fitness coach and a virtual gym membership for a year? i’m living proof here to say you can afford to feel your best! and i'd like nothing more than to help you to feel your best too! my monthly wellness club is in full swing! are you going to sit back and watch me for another month? or jump in and start reaching your own goals? i'll be waiting to hear from you! it may have taken me 4 years, but i am finally feeling like i'm back to a good place financially! when i got divorced, all of our assets were split as equally as possible and after selling the house, i was left with zero debt. sounds like i should have it made, right? wrong! over the next few years i made some foolish decisions on how my money was spent crazy high rent, a lot of eating out, weekends away, etc. and it took me a couple years to figure out that i couldn't afford to keep up that lifestyle. not with the income that i had coming in. fast forward a few years. i am now in my own home yes, i do have a mortgage. i am cooking at home which is definitely healthier too!. i am actually travelling no more weekends away somewhat locally but across the country and to the carribean. i am actually contributing to my savings account again...instead of constantly withdrawing just to pay bills. not only am i blessed to be a nurse, but my coaching business has definitely supplemented my income as well! i am not saying any of this to brag. i'm sharing my journey with you to provide hope. if nothing else, may my story inspire you to keep on trucking. i believe in you! beachbody does not guarantee any level of success or income from the team beachbody coach opportunity. each team beachbody coach income depends on his or her own efforts, diligence and skill. there's no time, there's never any time! jesse spano and if you're not sure who that is, i'm not sure we can be friends! kidding...but that definitely dates me! seriously...i hear this a lot! probably one of the most common objections i get when it comes to my coaching business is that people just don't have the time. it's amazing how putting ourselves first is such a chore. there are so many things that we take time for every day. but somehow when it comes to taking care of ourselves, we push that to the bottom of our to do list. so the no time thing...is that your honest truth? or is if just an excuse you tell yourself...maybe to let yourself of the hook? make yourself feel a little better? after all, we all have 24 hours in our day. it all comes down to choices. could you choose to get up 30 minutes earlier to get a workout in? could you choose to stop scrolling your social media to move your body? could you choose to that extra tv program tonight? you could. you definitely could. so what is stopping you from living your best life? what is stopping you from putting your needs into the equation on a daily basis? not sure where to begin? ready to get back on track? i've got your back! let's chat! i think i have the worst luck with electronics! i can not seem to keep anything charged... now my wireless phone charger doesn’t even work! i'm not sure if it's how i use them, how i charge them or just the products i use. but it is beyond frustrating! i just paid off my personal cell phone which is an iphone 8... thinking about upgrading... what phone recommendations do you have for me? what are the benefits? part of my morning routine? logging my activity and checking into my wellness club! these ladies get up and slay their mornings! starting your day on the right note... virtually cheering each other on... not only helps to hold myself accountable, it starts my day on a positive note which carries into the rest of my day! especially during these difficult times, it’s so important to have an outlet for all the things! so thankful to have these beautiful ladies in my life! looking for that additional layer of accountability and support? looking for a community of like minded, badass women? there’s still time to join us! dm for more information! nothing is as relaxing as sitting in the sun and reading a good book! it's not uncommon for me to be reading up to 4 books at once! i know that might sound crazy to some people, but they really all have a different purpose. typically one is a motivational book for my business, one is on mindset let's be real, that's pretty important!, one is more for fun light-hearted fiction, and of course my devotionals. i never really started reading until long after college. but now it’s one of my favorite things! what are some of your favorite books or authors? always looking for recommendations!! drop them below! i never used to use any types of supplements. i’d show up for my workout and do my best. but i knew i had more in me... thankfully, my mentor introduced me to a clean preworkout supplement. no artificial flavors or ingredients. no jittery side effects. just a simple jumpstart to my day! oh, and those workouts? i’m now giving 110! i seriously enjoy it so much that it’s not uncommon for me to use it as a pick me up during that mid-afternoon slump. i even drink it on my “rest” and recover days! i am not a coffee drinker. but this stuff? it’s what i imagine coffee is to others! hope you all have a great monday! cheers! oh, and if you’d like to know what i’m using?! let’s chat! how do you feel on sunday evenings? are you rested up and ready for the work week ahead? are you anxious, worried and maybe even scared of the work week to come? overwhelmed with all that lies ahead and needs to be done? i'm definitely the second one! the nice, relaxing weekend is over and it's time to get back to the grind! one thing i've found that has helped me is just really being present in the moment. whatever will be of tomorrow will be there tomorrow! worrying about it only makes you suffer twice! so why would you do that to yourself? “whatever you aren’t changing, you’re choosing.” making changes isn’t easy. that’s why so many people stay the same! we get stuck in our comfort zones, even if that zone isn’t a healthy place for us! you can either make the choice to stay where you are or you can choose to make a change! you have to find your why. why do you want to make the change? then hold on to that reason as tight as you can and use it as motivation to power through! this quote helps me start each day with the right mindset: i have to make a choice each day to be better than i was yesterday! what do you know needs to change but you haven’t made happen yet? anyone else get excited when you find a parking spot in the front row? well, don’t! if you’re trying to maintain a healthy, active lifestyle and maintain or progress with weight loss, please my friends… don’t underestimate your “bmr,” or basal metabolic rate! that’s the rate you burn calories while not exercising, and just doing basic daily activities. those little activities add up! take the stairs every chance you get. park a little further way. if you work at a desk, set a timer on your phone or watch for every 30 minutes to remind you to get up, and do some stretches! 30 minute intervals is ideal, but second best is getting 10 minutes of movement every hour! if you needed a friendly kick-in-the-pants to give up those front-row spots, this is it! this past week i finally got my hands on our newest product! it is a tea that is evidenced to reduce cravings...which i think a lot of us can use help with! it is recommended you drink it twice a day at least 30 minutes before meals and it comes in two delicious flavors! and at only 15 calories, it’s a win-win! i've been drinking this for about a week and have noticed that it definitely satisfies the cravings and encourages me to get more water in! sound like something you want to try? let me know! today is definitely a sad day! we are losing one of the kindest, most compassionate physicians i have ever had the privilege of working with...to retirement! i seriously wish him all the best as he starts his new role as a first time grandpa! this past week he made a point of taking time to speak to all of us nurses individually. he had so many kind words to say. but the one thing that struck me the most was: “sometimes i think you’re too hard on yourself”. yes, yes, yes...i know. and it’s not the first time i’ve heard that. why is being kind to yourself so difficult? think about the thoughts that run through your mind about yourself. would you ever speak to another person that way? so next time you have those thoughts, throw them out the window and replace them with what you’d say to someone else. in time your thinking will change. and you will be a better person because of it! can anyone believe that it’s almost the end of july already? i’m sure for some of you this has been the longest few months ever... for some of you maybe not much has changed. either way, things have definitely been different. having had to work throughout the pandemic, i’m actually shocked how fast the last few months have gone. for us in the midwest that means summer is drawing to a close. the days are getting shorter. the cool weather will be here before we know it. while i’ve still been able to make some good memories this summer and even snuck in a quick getaway “up north”, i’m still going to make the most of the month of august!! do you have any plans before the summer wraps up? i’ve been talking with a lot of parents and teachers lately about what is to come of school this fall. not having kids, i don’t really know how i feel about distance learning vs in person school this fall. there have been times in my life i’ve wondered how my life would have been different if i’d had children. but it’s times like this that i actually feel lucky that kids weren’t in the cards for me. no matter what happens, everyone will be needing to get back into some type of routine. right? that’s why i’m so excited to announce my next wellness group...rock your routine! if you’re needing additional support getting back into a routine...i’ve got you covered! hit me up! today marked the start of week 2 for me of the newest workout program! here i am super sweaty after today’s workout. and i just happened to be twinning with the trainer today! if you saw my stories, i didn’t actually workout with my shirt tucked in like this! but i am absolutely sore in the craziest places! i love that we have so many different programs which always keeps the body guessing! i can already feel my body changing and can’t wait to see my final results! if you’ve been following along on my stories and are interested in the program i’m currently doing...good news! vip early access opens to customers today!! this has been the hottest launch of all time! and i’d hate for you to miss it! drop me a message if you’re interested in hearing more about it!! this weekend was supposed to be my little town's yearly celebration. it should have been filled with all kinds of memory making events... i should have been throwing candy out to kids during the parade. i should have been getting some tasty eats at the food trucks. i should have been playing bingo with my mom in the bank parking lot. i should have been dancing the night away at the street dance. and just having fun! instead, i've laid low all day. caught up on a few things around the house and cleaned up the dvr a little bit! it's actually been kind of nice but i'm a little sad that i wasn't able to get out, see people i hardly ever get to see and just have a good time! there’s always next year i guess! what have you all been doing to stay connected with others during this time? have you missed any important events or had to postpone anything? ○○follow loop○○ connect with ladies on ig and grow together! follow these easy steps to join the loop: ¹ follow me ² like save this post, leave a comment below, hi! i'm i am excited to connect with you! ³ go follow @fellow.females and follow everyone they are following to be added then comment done on their loop post! that’s it! i only drink one soda a day... a little white lie that i tell myself! actually it's not completely untrue. but the fact of the matter is...it's not a 12 oz can of soda...it's this big guy! because soda from a fountain tastes so much better than from a can or bottle! am i right? drinking diet pop as we call it in the midwest! is seriously one of my biggest downfalls! like i seriously used to drink it all day every day! it's not uncommon to lie to ourselves to make us feel less guilty about the choices we make. as for me, i've been working hard on getting more water in especially with the heat and humidity we've had! and only treating myself to a 12 oz can once in awhile! think about your daily life... what lies do you tell yourself? is there one small shift you can make in your thinking that will give you a different outcome? is there one small change you can make that will positively improve your life? sometimes it's the small things, that add up over time, that will make the biggest difference! have you ever heard of the ripple effect? when you create positive improvements in your life, you create positive ripples that spread out all around you, like a pebble of positivity dropped in a pond. jeff olson in the slight edge like seriously, how cool is that? have you ever really thought about it? when you reach out and positively affect one other person through your interactions and words you create a slight change in that person, who is then more likely to reach out and positively affect someone else. jeff olson in the slight edge so today, my friends, i challenge you to do one thing that will send those ripples into the universe. it could be as simple as smiling and saying hello to a stranger at the grocery store. you just never know who might just need that little bit of kindness at that very moment. let's spread that kindness around like a virus! i used to think starting my own business required either a masters degree in business, being rich, or both. what i wasn’t willing to admit that i was hiding a lack of faith in myself, and a major fear of failure. something straight. up. magic happened when i took those first steps of faith, though!!! once i pushed past the doubts and kept at it… just pushing past the inner mean girl whenever she tried to tell me it wasn’t going to work… i started to see growth. progress. real change. the brand new empowerment i felt set off a “snowball effect” that spilled into every area of my life!!! i have zero doubt the x factor that changed everything for me was having my mentor walking with me every step of the way. i saved time and money by learning from someone else’s experience. i was never alone. support and answers were always available whenever i needed them! going to retreats and being part of a new sisterhood has left my heart bursting. that inner mean girl doesn’t get the first say any more. she doesn't know what she's talking about anyway! i always get so excited to share my story! if any of it is relatable to you or sounds like what you’ve been looking for, my team is hosting a glimpse event tomorrow night! come join us to see what this business is actually about and how you can make it your own! no strings attached! message me for the link to join us! everyone has thier day 1! i was never one to workout with any consistency. i didn't play sports in high school. even though i'm a nurse and i knew exercise was good for me, i just never really knew what to do, when to do it, or how to go about it. and going to a gym? no way in hell! honestly, to this day, working out with other people really isn't my jam. so when i was introduced to at home workouts...and started seeing results? i was hooked! i absolutely love that there are so many programs to choose from! it takes all the guess work out! most importantly, you can keep changing it up to keep your body guessing! today was another day 1 for me! our newest program launched and i am going all in! the best way to burn fat is to combine both muscle building and cardio...and that's just what this new program is about! looking for a new routine of your own? looking to change things up a little? you know where to find me! i’m just a message away! the last few days i have literally been glued to my computer! you see, this week i should have been in new orleans at our yearly coaching event. of course that all changed when covid decided to rear it's ugly head! fortunately, they were able to provide so many trainings and events to us virtually! literally, all my free time in the last 3 days has been spent catching up on the latest and greatest! although i appreciate all that they have done for us this week, there was definitely something missing... last year when i traveled to indianapolis, i met some of the most amazing women on my team and new friends were made. and that is what i missed the most! i seriously can't wait until next year when we will be in st. louis...together again! i already bought my ticket!! it has been so tough not being able to be with others during the last few months. i'm sure a lot of you are feeling the same. the one thing i am grateful for is the community that this work has brought to me. we have been able to continue to connect with each other online and my monthly wellness clubs are a great place to connect with other like minded women who are literally crushing their goals! the theme this year was isn't that the truth! are you looking for a community of women with whom you can crush your own girls and build your dream life? double tap and comment yes!! let's chat! one of my favorite memories from growing up is the summer days spent at the pool. we’d ride our bikes across town to the public pool. spend hours there and then trek back home...towels around the neck. of course by the time we got home we were ready to cool off again! but that’s the best part! my mom would have all the blinds pulled. it would feel so cool as you walked in the door. and then...ice cream! not just any ice cream, but the best ice cream. not sure if i can say the brand but it’s locally made! just one scoop of vanilla...in a cake cone. now i’m sure this didn’t happen every day, but it sure sticks out in my mind! today it is steamy hot! if i could, i’d take myself back to that simpler time to enjoy it all over again! what’s one of your favorite childhood summer memories? does your job 𝕋𝕆𝕋𝔸𝕃𝕃𝕐 get in the way of living the life you'd wished for? yeah...same here! this week i was supposed to be attending a yearly event in new orleans....which of course was transitioned to all virtual. i also accidentally took the wrong week off from work! so here i am trying to binge watch all the training sessions i've missed while at work. also just got word from my mom that my aunt and uncle's race horse just won her race tonight! i could have been there tonight too, but here i sit at home...on call for work. my hope is that one day i can call the shots. i can work on my own schedule. i can attend events without having to worry about who else is taking time off or getting my vacation request in on time or correct for that matter!. i can spend time with my family on a week night without having to worry about what night i'm on call. this coaching that i do? just might be what gets me there! what goals or dreams do you have for your worklife balance? you know how they say transformation starts from within? i now know that to be true. although my weight is yet to be where i'd like it to be. although my before and after photos show only slight differences in my opinion after all we're our own worst critics!. although i may not look like other coaches out there... my body is continually changing. after catching up on all my doctor appointments, i received some of the best news! for years i've struggled with high cholesterol. i've always blamed my thyroid disease and genetics after all, it runs in the family. and while all that definitely plays a roll in things, i know my lifestyle and eating habits also contributed to this although i'd be the last to admit it!. for the first time in years, thanks to diet and exercise, all my cholesterol levels are within normal limits on no medication! so if you're like me and maybe not seeing the results you're looking for. know that within you something amazing is happening. hang in there. stay consistent. the results will come! you have to choose every day! you have to choose to make healthy choices when eating. you have to choose to move your body purposefully. you have to choose how you're going to feel and show up in this world. if you didn't have to choose, it would be easy...and you'd already be doing it. what are you going to choose for yourself....today, tomorrow and the next day? looking for some inspiration along the way? ask me about my july accountability group where we talk about all these things! would love to have you join us!

let me know and i’ll send you the link! health is a bigger topic than ever right now, and ironically enough, one of the biggest enemies to a healthy immune system is stress. a couple quick ways to tell your brain it’s ok: 1. long, slow, deep breathing! take 4 deep inhales and let them go slowly- then take inventory of how you feel! it’s crazy!! 2. gratitude! for real- it causes chemicals to change in your brain! think of 3 things you’re thankful for right now, and really sit on them for few minutes. go extra crazy and say them out loud to yourself. did you try it? what are your go to stress relievers? you’ll often find me sitting in the sun reading a good book! have you ever been away but just wanted to get home? i have had the best time and the not so best time away from home. while i love the scenery and just being “away” from everything. there is just one thing i couldn’t shake. for so many years, i have used travel as a way to “run away” from everything that wasn’t going right in my world. and while it’s great to get out and explore new places and meet new people, nothing else in your life truly changes. except for in that moment. the crap you have at home, or maybe even brought along with you, still remains. it isn’t until we can dig deep and address those issues that we are truly free. that we can truly be happy. my wish is that everyone can find a place like that...it starts from within. have you ever heard anyone say i regret that workout! yeah, i didn't think so... working out should make you feel fit, healthy, happy, and strong! gyms are in different stages of opening, but that doesn’t mean you can’t start getting back to that feeling. there is a new program releasing at the end of the month and it’s ideal for those of us who want to get back to a fit lifestyle without going back to the gym. it’s all about losing fat and gaining muscle in 3 weeks of intense workouts. followed by an advanced 3 week program! all from the comfort of your own home with minimal equipment required! it’s going to be exactly what we need to get blasted back into shape and quick! my next fit club is starting soon! let’s do this! drop an emoji below for more information! feels so good to be a little unplugged! enjoying my time in our beautiful state. enjoying a place i’ve never visited. so peaceful and quiet! makes me glad i forgot my laptop! it’s here! my new workout finally dropped and i can already tell i am going to be so sore! with the daily stresses of life, these 30 minutes for me are just what i need. here are some facts i’m focusing on: high intensity workouts like burn calories and fat... long after you finish working out- i am turning my body into a fat burning machine! asymmetrical movements and my new bod rope keep the workout fun and moving! i am sweaty and finished in no time! stress relief! this world is so crazy right now- my workout is for my sanity and helps clear my head! want in? i have a few more spots in my test group and would love for you to join me! drop your favorite emoji below and i’ll send over all the details! while we’ve been worrying about covid-19... the covid 15 crept in and took over! symptoms of covid 15 are weight gain, lack of motivation, and an increased love of ice cream and pizza! curing yourself of covid 15 is totally doable! it’s important to start with baby steps! even if before the coronavirus hit you were in great shape and working out daily, you have to take baby steps. your body needs time to get back into the rhythm of working out and eating healthy! what are you doing to stay healthy and active? personally my monthly accountability groups have kept me on track! we have an awesome new program launching tomorrow with access to two different nutrition programs! sound like something that might be just what you need to get back on track? let me know! i’m here for you! hope you all had a safe and happy 4th of july! free workout currently in search of some amazing women to pilot our newest workout program! build lean muscle? burn fat? heck yes!! the sample released this week and it was amazing! and i’d love for you to get vip access to it! this opportunity only happens 1-2 times a year! so let me know if you want in asap! the only expectation is you try the workout and let me know what you think! free! literally, just 30 minutes of your time!! this program is going to be amazing! great for those just starting out and those cross training as well! a little weight lifting. a little cardio. some awesome beats... it is going to be awesome! drop an emoji in the comments for access to the workout! comparison is the thief of joy! i've heard that saying many times throughout the years. sometimes it's so easy to hear the words, but much harder to live by them until you find yourself in the thick of the comparison game. this is one thing that i've been working on and it still tends to creep in my thoughts more often than i'd like to admit. but the thing is... we are all fighting our own battles. much of what we show the world isn't our whole truth. and i can tell you this... that person you're comparing yourself to? i bet they've got some baggage you wouldn't want anything to do with! no one is perfect! so learn to love yourself for who you are! be proud of what you have! and in your quest to be nice to others...start with yourself! b u r n o u t i love my life and what i do, but i can get rolling too hard for too long and have to be careful i don’t let burnout creep up on me. anyone else? i’ve had a super low key weekend. maybe you’d even call it lazy! but it was much needed...and listening to your body is important too! other go-to’s when i start feeling overwhelmed: bullet journaling meditation a long walk got any go-to’s? give me your secrets social media is a bunch of smoke and mirrors. we curate our lives into a bunch of pretty squares, and honestly... i have a lovehate relationship with that! although i love pretty things and appreciate the effort and talent it takes to make beautiful pictures and fun captions!! i just have to remind myself that all these little squares are tiny pieces of what’s actually happening, and what that moment was actually like! today, this is my hustle. i got up early, worked out, checked in with my fitness community, went to work, ate a lunch i meal-prepped over the weekend, and tonight after dinner i finally sorted the stack of mail i’ve been avoiding for days! no beaches and bikinis today… just busy building my own dream life right here!!! what are you up to this friday night? “when you get in the habit of observing behavior, rather than just listening to what people say, you’ll place your trust in the right people.” seriously… this truth has totally shaped who i surround myself with!! i’m blown away by the women in my tribe! they’re the most consistent and intentional badass babes i know! they show up and do the work! they push me and encourage me to be a stronger, better version of myself. i am missing them like crazy right now! and i can’t wait until we can be together in person again soon! who are you surrounding yourself with? if we don’t earn something, the value just isn’t the same! we’re gonna take care of something we worked hard to get! we’re all wired to show up when we’ve got some skin in the game! am i right? and that is why i workout. it’s 20-40 minutes a day that is just for me, to take care of the only body i’ll ever have to enjoy life in. heck yeah i wanna rock my shorts and tanks this summer- but i also want the satisfaction of knowing i’m capable of achieving my goals. just because i can. this can apply to anything! so how are you investing in yourself right now? what is something that is just for you? what is a dad? a dad is someone who wants to catch you before you fall but instead picks you up, brushes you off, and lets you try again. a dad is someone who wants to keep you from making mistakes but instead lets you find your own way, even though his heart breaks in silence when you get hurt. a dad is someone who holds you when you cry, scolds you when you break the rules, shines with pride when you succeed, and has faith in you even when you fail... -unknown happy father’s day to all the men who have taken on this role! especially this guy right here! love you dad! just because it’s the weekend don’t let it be your “weak” end! it’s so easy to stay on schedule, stay on task, workout, eat right, and stick to your sleep schedule during the week. don’t let all that hard work go to waste just because the weekend is here! try to stay on a schedule that is similar to a weekday. plan your meals ahead of time to take the guesswork out of things. move your body aka exercise first thing in the morning so as the day gets busy you won't have excuses. trust me. you’ll thank yourself come monday! do you eat to feel happy? do you binge on netflix to feel happy? do you go on a shopping spree to feel happy? i’m going to kill that buzz to show you the science behind why it’s a fake happiness!! don’t hate me, just read on so you can make educated choices if you’re still gonna eat the ice cream, ok? the computer in our heads aka our brain makes two “happiness” chemicals: dopamine only touches 5 brain receptors. it’s from acts of short-term pleasure, is addictive, and just leaves you wanting more. it actually creates reward-seeking loops so you will repeat these pleasurable behaviors! think binge-eating, addiction, etc. seratonin touches 14 brain receptors. from acts of long-term satisfaction, not addictive, and leaves you thankful and content with where you are and what you have. it also helps regulate mood, appetite, digestion, sleep, and memory. one of the best ways to increase your levels? exercise! it has taken me years to figure out that instant gratification is not what makes us happy in the long run. yes, i still indulge in sweet treats or a shopping spree once in awhile, but i know that this only results in moments of happiness. since i've been working out on a regular basis and fueling my body with healthier food, i've noticed a few things... when i start my day with exercise, my mind, my mood and my attitude are in a much better place. when i fuel my body with healthy foods, i actually crave them not the junk! next time you’re in a funk, remember this!!! “sometimes we’re tested not to show our weaknesses, but to discover our strengths.” whoa! i know that whenever i’ve been pushed to what i thought was the end of myself, i’ve found new depths to pull from that i would never have known i’ve had! double tap if you’ve been there too! if you could get paid to… live a healthy lifestyle and take care of yourself... help others reach their fitness goals while reaching yours too!... work anywhere with wifi meaning time with the fam or whoever you want, whenever you want because it’s on your schedule... travel to amazing fitness events and hang with an incredible community throughout the year... ….would you do it? ‘cause i have spots opening up and i can mentor you!! so if your answer is yes, i have an amazing opportunity taking place tomorrow night! join our team for a sneak peek into coaching! so drop me a gif or emoji and let’s get to it! “we often are so scared of taking that leap of faith either to connect with people, or to allow ourselves to be ourselves without judging, that we stay where we are and feel trapped there.” jodi aman that was sooo me!! i denied my heart and soul for way too long. so thankful to have taken that leap and be truly 100 myself!!!! anyone else feel this?? iғ ʏᴏᴜ’ʀᴇ sɪᴄᴋ ᴏғ sᴛᴀʀᴛɪɴɢ ᴏᴠᴇʀ, sᴛᴏᴘ ɢɪᴠɪɴɢ ᴜᴘ! those words were spoken my my trainer this morning and really struck a cord. how many times have you started something and stopped because it was too hard? how many times have you started something and stopped because you weren’t seeing results quick enough? how many times have you started something and stopped because of other people’s opinions? heck, maybe you’ve even stopped before you’ve started because you talk yourself out of it before you even try! tʜᴇ ᴏɴʟʏ ᴛʜɪɴɢ ɪ ᴄᴀɴ ᴘʀᴏᴍɪsᴇ ʏᴏᴜ ɪs ᴛʜɪs...you will never get there if you keep giving up. so what is it? what is truly keeping you from changing your life? do you ever have one of those days....you're seriously just trying to be a decent human being...and everything seems to blow up in your face? like, not today my friend! not today! but yes...today. we are living in such difficult times. it is hard not to have an emotional reaction to what is going on around you. and that’s obviously one thing i need to work on. but you know what? it’s also ok to have emotions. after all it is what makes us human. and one thing i will never apologize for is being authentically me! to quote a great coworker...”we can all lose our shit once in awhile, we just can’t all lose our shit on the same day!” can you relate? ᗩᑎotᕼᗴᖇ ᑭᖇoᘜᖇᗩᗰ iᑎ tᕼᗴ ᗷookᔕ! helloooooooo endorphin rush!! i never, ever ever thought i’d see the day where i’d be that girl who works out consistently but now i crave it. miracles really do happen! thank heaven it was so much simpler than i was making it all those years... now to decide what to do next! follow along on my stories or on my page to see! better yet, there’s still time to join my june wellness group! join us to receive daily motivation and encouragement from other strong women! message me for more info! feeling some quarantine fluff creeping up on you like what the heck is happening?? my fitness community is focusing aaaalll on how to lose the fluff this month!! if that’s on your to-do list too, drop an emoji if you want to join in!! shhh…don’t tell anyone! i eat clean and workout so i can treat myself to all the things! because 10 year old me is still in there…heck, 21 year old me is still in there! but you know what? that’s ok! nobody is perfect. no one can be “on” 100 of the time. if you set yourself up for perfection. you set yourself up for failure. focus on being “on” at least 80 of the time. don’t beat yourself up if you fall “off the wagon”. pick yourself up and try again. the next meal. the next day. treat. don’t cheat. this is a lifestyle. it’s not a diet. and it must be sustainable. looking for help with your nutrition and meal planning? i’ve got you! message me for more info! got something you’ve been afraid of trying? been there way too many times! humor me for a minute. i want you to stop right now and write down all of the reasons you don’t think it won’t work out. go to the very worst possible outcome in your head… then get it all out on paper! then assess. is the failure really so bad? so many times in my life, i was making a bigger deal of potential failure than the actual failure would be!! let’s say… you’re into someone and are afraid to initiate. what’s the worst that could happen? is rejection really that life-ending? let’s say… you’re dreaming of a different job. if you took the leap and it didn’t work out, could you recover? let’s say you hate it, or it doesn’t pan out like you thought it would. odds are pretty dang high that you would pivot, and be okay. let’s say… you’ve been dreaming of losing those last few pounds and getting fit. so.. what is it? double tap if you get stuck in your head with stuff like this!! i totally believe in our own power to decide our destiny. it’s in our choices… and that includes who surround ourselves with along the way! no one is an island. no one is alone is this. we’re not wired to do life alone, and sometimes we’re part of a circle chosen for us- like our family. but other times we can 100 customize our circle of influence with friends, teachers, mentors, etc that encourage us to keep working to be the best humans we can be!!! this is why i’m always mindful of who i let influence me! my family, my business, and my future self will thank me. when i look back, i’m already eternally grateful for my tribe. fitness is about way more than losing pounds and inches. it’s an avenue. the scale only a tool. it’s about recharging, finding your potential, feeling good, and refocusing on what matters. the most important change is the one on the inside! what good is it to look hot if you’re still miserable?? what could you do if you had access to: hundreds of workouts for all fitness levels pro athlete. first-timer. injury recovery. elderly. and more! an incredible online community of like-minded people to inspire, challenge and cheer you on!!! one of my favorite parts!! workout anywhere. you don’t even have to have internet!!! i love to download my favorite workouts for vacation so i can feel good no matter where i am! hello, yoga on the beach! want to try a workout on me? comment below! better yet, my june wellness club is kicking off soon! would love to have you join us!! you can’t pour from an empty cup. your spouse…kids…family…coworkers and friends… they can’t receive the best of you if you’re not doing what brings it out. for a while, i was weighed down with guilt any time i took time for myself, or spent money on just me. especially if it was something i could live without. but you know what? self-care isn’t selfish! it’s one of the best gifts we can give to those around us! one thing i did? i found a workout plan that allowed me to carve out time wherever i was, and move. no waiting for class to start at the gym, or the doors to open, or losing time driving there and back. i clear out my space, get out the weights, pump the volume and sweat it out. i’m so excited to share my progress with you guys!! this is your permission to take stock of what you need today. do you need to get up and move? what’s your heart and soul a little low on? interested in learning more? i’m here for you! and i’m currently getting some amazing women set up on their own journeys for the month on june! there’s still time and room to join us!! most of us know that weight loss happens in the kitchen. your food intake determines 80 of your results!!!! this would be a heck of a lot easier if we’d been better equipped for success with nutrition!! instead of being surrounded by fast food, junky snacks and commercials glamorizing it all!! in other countries, you can get fresh, healthy food easily for next to nothing!! no wonder it’s such a fight for so many of us! so there’s a learning curve for us. we have to figure out how to eat fresh, affordable food that cures those cravings and keeps us satisfied. i've got two amazing nutrition programs to offer, one of which will definitely be a good fit for you! no dieting required! trust me! you'll definitely be eating more food than you could ever imagine! if you're interested in learning more, let me know! i knew how to lose weight. i didn’t know how to keep it off. it didn’t matter how much i was shedding or how my excitement was building… i couldn’t shake the nagging fear that it would creep back. i was constantly scared of falling off the track and back into my bad habits. i mean living in the midwest, there are only so many outdoor activities you can do in a blizzard and not the best access to fresh produce! for me, my inconsistency was actually linked to fear of the gym. seriously, i'm afraid of them! my life actually changed when i realized i did not have to go to the gym at all! no gym meant: not having to care or be afraid of what others would think of me. zero travel time, i mean, unless you count the walk down the stairs! routines that are planned out for me, taking the guess work out of what to do! a very happy budget. those classes, membership fees, and gas all add up!!! am i right? my schedule needed a workout option that was flexible to work with my daily life.. not the other way around. i couldn’t be happier with the results and the new consistency! i want soooo bad for you to experience the empowerment and new excitement for summer that i’ve found. if this sounds like something you’ve been looking for, like this post and let’s talk about it!

not doing enough or accomplishing something with our lives if we’re not tired and running around all the time. for some, slowing down can be scary…not only for financial reasons, but some of us like to stay occupied to hide from our thoughts. for some of us, we need to give ourselves more permission to slow down. take inventory of what our heart is telling us. our hearts and bodies always know what we need… most of time we’re just not listening!! has something good come from this time for you? two things that make me feel the most alive: helping others and seeing new parts of the world! even if it’s just a new fun city in my home state!! when i travel, i want to see as much as possible… which means i’m packing my walking shoes because i’ll be on the move! it's tough right now not being able to go anywhere or do much of anything. it's tough not knowing how to plan for vacation time i've requested. it's tough that trips that i had planned a year ago will not be happening. but, as hard as that is, i really need everyone to continue to stay home right now... why? 1 to protect the vulnerable and make less work for me! 2 to protect yourself and those you love. 3 i want to travel again! how about you? if you could be anywhere else right now, where would it be?? i know i’d be far away from where i am! hopefully on a beach with a blended drink in my hand! reasons it’s hard to not gain wait during this time so go easy on yourself!: stress! our bodies store more fat when we’re in a state of stress. minimizing it isn’t always easy, but quality sleep, baths, meditationlong deep breaths are some of my go-to’s that calm my body and slow my mind! emotional eating. less access to fresh healthy food. lower quality meals due to income loss and budget changes. less movement throughout the day from being inside, stuck in one place. i could add so many more, but i just wanted to point out a few. remember to you to give yourself grace. wrestling with guilt around weight gain isn’t a bad thing, necessarily... it’s normal! so don’t shame yourself for feeling shame! i know that vicious cycle all too well and am so thankful for the community of women that showed me how to break out of it. but that's the key. you need to work past the guilt and shame in order to break through it! every day is a new day to get it right. like this post if it hit you right in the feels today!! i remember the day i was diagnosed with hypothyroidism. it seems like it took forever to come to the right diagnosis. and even then, it took 18 months to get my levels to normal. i remember sitting in my doctor's office and just breaking down. i was so tired. i was so sad. i felt like such a failure! and where did that lead me? antidepressants. we as a society are always looking for that quick fix...and at the time it sounded like a good idea. i took those medications for years. i was rotated to at least 3 different medications during that time. and you know what? i'm not sure that any of them every helped. why? because it wasn't clinical depression! the depression i was feeling was a symptom of my underactive thyroid. it has taken years to get to where i am today. with a hopefully stable thyroid level can't get checked due to i have the best mindset that i've had in years. and you know what? i'm no longer taking an antidepressant! not to say that i don't have my ups and downs at all! because i am human! but the daily workouts, the personal mindset growth, the supportive community, the healthy eating all of which i've welcomed into my life through this amazing coaching opportunity? that has been the best medicine for me! now, i'm not telling you to quit your medications cold turkey no! but if you're looking for additional support and motivation to live your best life...i'm here for you! happy mother’s day!! hope you all have a wonderful day! i am absolutely loving the fact that it's grilling season again here in the midwest and i'm always looking for healthy substitutions for the traditional comfort foods! give me all the cheeseburgers! i came across this recipe for southwest turkey bacon cheeseburgers and it sounds so delicious. i mean how can you go wrong with bacon and cheese?! https:www.mccormick.comgrill-matesrecipesmain-dishessouthwest-turkey-bacon-cheeseburgers i'm not so sure about the avocado though... would you put avocado on a burger? happy nurse's week to all my fellow nurses out there! nurse's week begins on may 6 and runs through may 12 florence nightingale's birthday. florence nightingale is considered the founder of modern nursing. however, as a hospice nurse, i tend to relate more to another famous nurse... dame cicely saunders, the founder of the hospice movement. after all, that's what i do! know the the world, now more than ever appreciates you! i hope you all have a great week! i'll leave you with this quote: you matter because you are you, and you matter to the last moment of your life. we will do all we can, not only to help you die peacefully, but also live until you die. -dame cicely saunders there’s just so much change right now…and we’re all pretty sure that even after things start opening up again, it might be a very long time before things go back to normal…if they ever will. it’s truly a time where people are having to step up and step out to try new things. so many people are being forced to pivot right now, especially those in the fitness industry. although there is so much unknown out there, what i do know is this... i never used to enjoy working out...but now i have a group of ladies who expect to see my smiling face on the daily. this definitely helps me hold myself accountable! i used to feel sad and depressed...but the mindset shift that has taken place since i started coaching has been huge! i used to feel so alone...but my fitness community has become tighter and stronger than ever right now, and i couldn’t be more thankful! i’ve always been fulfilled by helping others and seeing them reach their goals and that hasn't changed! if you’re anything like me and have been looking for a sign, this might be yours! i am looking for women who are focused, driven and consistent but also looking for more to join me is this adventure! my team is hosting a virtual girls night in tomorrow night. some of the coaches on my team will be sharing their stories of how this opportunity has impacted them in profound ways and how we believe it can impact you too! i've reserved 5 spots! come and find out more about what i do...no stings attached! if this speaks to you even a little bit, let's chat! not going to lie. i’ve never had an easy time making friends. don’t get me wrong. i can talk to anyone, anywhere, anytime. but it’s all small talk. no real connection. and i tell you what. it definitely hasn’t gotten easier as an adult! especially being that i don’t have kids. so many people i meet are busy with kids activities and are connected with people they know through their kids. i’ve learned the hard way what a true friend really is. but those good ones are definitely keepers for life! when i first started my own journey i had no idea the community that would come with it! i have found an amazing community of women with like minded goals. i have added people i know in real life and have met virtually to my growing team. and you know what? they’re legit! anyone who is willing to be vulnerable enough to entrust you with their health and well-being? good people! i’m so happy to have found this amazing, supportive community! are you looking for something more? i’m here for you! my team is here for you! we are just waiting for you!! it's grilling season! and i finally got my lp tank filled this week! one of my favorite ways to prepare food in the summer months is by using the grill! i just hate having to turn my oven or stovetop on and heat up the whole house. a lot of people cook just their meat on the grill.... however, i love quick, easy meals that can be completely cooked on the grill. i have become somewhat of a tinfoil artist! this is a quick way to steam all the veggies! yum! and those grill mats?! game changer! what are your favorite things to grill? gas or charcoal? can i just say something here real quick? the next time you look critically in the mirror or guilt yourself for eating that dessert, just remember: you are someone else’s body goals. you might know what your best is- and that’s great! numbers and shapes are different for everyone. for example…if you’re still trying to get your thighs to socially distance themselves, consider the fact that your anatomy might never be meant for that! this is one area i've struggled with for a long time! before i could make any real long-term progress, i had to meet my body right where it was... and apologize for hating it because it didn’t look like everyone else promoting cute activewear on social media. just keeping it real. once my relationship with my body changed…everything else did too. i’m always open to share more about my journey! just drop a comment or shoot over a message! does this resonate with you?? enrollment will be closing soon for my may wellness club! i'd love to have you join us! “be thankful for the difficult people in your life, for they have shown you who you do not want to be.” ain’t that the truth?!?! don’t be that person! mindset is something that i definitely work hard on every day. it is so easy to slip back into my old ways of thinking and doing. i mean you can’t undo dang near 40 years of habits and thoughts in a day or two! i am definitely not perfect, but in the very least, i am improving. one small thought at a time. who are you striving to be? when i started my wellness journey a year and a half ago, i definitely had a different version of myself in my mind. i wasn't even concerned about being healthy... i just wanted to look the part. in my mind, i wanted to be skinny. i wanted to have a flat stomach. i wanted to look great in whatever clothes i wanted to wear. friends, i'm here to tell you a little secret... don’t believe the lie that “healthy” or “in shape” looks the same on everyone. and thank goodness it doesn’t! what a boring world we’d live in! using fake, impossible standards as fuel for working out is a fast-track to self-hatred and disappointment, and that’s just heartbreaking!! i knew i couldn't continue with that type of mindset, so i had to try something different. i started meeting myself right where i was at… by recognizing what my body can do and what my body’s best looks like- and focusing on improving that. the results?? the most beautiful relationship with myself i could imagine and it feels like freedom. i’m fueled by energy and gratitude…and those results don’t just show in my body anymore, but glow through my face. and that, my friends, doesn’t lie. are you looking for support in becoming the best version of you? are you having trouble knowing where to start? i'm here for you! enrollment is now open for my may wellness club! you may be thinking what is that? in my wellness clubs we focus on the following: daily workouts from home!! clean eating meal plans! and, last but not least, a positive mindset! i only have 5 spots available!! so, if you'd like to see if it would be a good fit for you, let's chat asap! nurses! hang in there! this sucks! there, i said it. what so many others are probably thinking. what absolutely kills me is what our patients and their families are having to go through. i can't even imagine not being able to see or touch my loved one, especially when they're so sick! {if you know me or my sister also a nurse we’d be busting through walls to get at our loved ones! i may not be directly on “the front lines” but it has still affected my job in many ways. so many of our vital services in hospice are on hold due to visiting restrictions. let’s be honest. they could care less about the nurse! like give me massage and music therapy!! our patients in nursing homes and assisted livings are so isolated! and for some of them the hospice staff are the only visitors they get. although i understand, it is hard. no denying that. i pray that we can have some sense of normalcy again soon. until then... control the controllable. let go of the rest. be positive. be grateful. be mindful. stay strong. stay healthy. stay humble. and keep doing the amazing work you’re doing! in solidarity, a hospice nurse. been doing a lot of self reflection lately. i mean what else is there to do?! back in december of 2018 i was at a pretty low point. i'd been through a lot in the last two years...divorced. stalked by my neighbor. sold a house. moved. entered a troubled relationship. bought a house. moved again. the list could go on and on... i felt unhappy. i was overweight. i wasn't eating well. i lacked energy and motivation to do anything. thank you underactive thyroid! here i was making huge life decisions, but when were things going to get better? truth bomb the answer was right inside of me the whole time! i started to notice that one of my coworkers was making significant changes in her life and sharing her journey on social media. i reached out to her and made the scary decision to dive in to the same programs she was doing. and that's when my life started to pivot. i found that losing weight didn't have to be difficult simple, daily lifestyle changes. i found that fueling my body with healthy, whole foods and eating to fuel my body was a game changer goodbye emotional eating! i found that these simple changes, done consistently, provided me with lasting results. i found that no one can hold you accountable except you! but, having a group of women showing up for you daily is a great motivator! i found that happiness is found inside of me not in someone else or bright, shiny new things. i've also found that all these things combined are the best therapy i could ever imagine! been there, done that too! my journey is far from over. but i know one thing....i'll never go back and i'll never stop trying. i get it. it can be a scary thing to try something new. but really, what do you have to lose? if this speaks to you at all, we need to talk! thinking back to a simpler time...really just a few months ago! after years of planning too many schedules to work around!, we were finally able to take our family girls trip to belize! i am so grateful that we got to spend this time together because in just a matter of a couple weeks of returning home, life as we know it, changed. no more travel. many having to cancel their own adventures. no more social gathering. and at this point in time, it seems like no end is in sight. at least not the near future! my trip in july has already been canceled. so, i'm going to have to get creative this year. i really enjoy traveling ok, maybe not the actual travel part! but submersing myself in new cities and cultures is pretty cool. what are your go to ideas for day trips or staycations? sharing this stuff always makes me nervous but it’s always worth it... i started my fitness journey back in 2018… this time wasn’t the same, though. i started digging deeper and looking for something different… because obviously what i was doing wasn’t working. i needed something sustainable. not a 30-day deprivation plan.. but something livable! turning it into a side hustle that would keep me fit and pay for the fun stuff wasn’t even the plan at first!! i was just passionate to share what i’d found with others and help them find the freedom i had!! if you’ve been waiting for a huge neon sign to flash in the sky pointing the way out of that ugly cycle of ups and downs… we need to talk! my free group starts tomorrow! there's still time for you to join us! we will be focusing on movement, mindset and nutrition! no strings attached! message me to be added to the group! being that i'm still working full time as a nurse, i so look forward to my days off! i am very much a person of routine. being that i get up at 5:30 am on work days, i'm often up by 6 at the latest on my days off even though i don't use an alarm!. but lately i can't help but thinking what am i going to do all day? i never seem to have a problem filling my days...i think it's just something about knowing that nothing is open and you can't hang out with others...that just makes the day ahead seem so long! i am trying to be intentional with my time but it isn't always easy! i find myself getting lost in pointless activities all too often! what are you all doing to fill your days? are you keeping to a normal schedule? my girl 𝔹ℝ𝔼ℕ𝔼 𝔹ℝ𝕆𝕎ℕ bringing the fire! “a lot of cheap seats in the arena are filled with people who never venture onto the floor. they just hurl mean-spirited criticisms and put-downs from a safe distance. the problem is, when we stop caring what people think and stop feeling hurt by cruelty, we lose our ability to connect. but when we’re defined by what people think, we lose the courage to be vulnerable. therefore, we need to be selective about the feedback we let into our lives. for me, if you’re not in the arena also getting your ass kicked, i’m not interested in your feedback.” surround yourself with people who encourage you to 𝚂𝚃𝙴𝙿 𝙸𝙽𝚃𝙾 𝚃𝙷𝙴 𝙰𝚁𝙴𝙽𝙰!! i am hosting a free group next week where we will focus on nutrition, movement and mindset! join us for a week of inspiring, positive feedback to help you connect with other like minded individuals! can't wait to see you inside! anyone else out there barely holding it together? not gonna lie, i had quite the breakdown earlier this week. you know how they say when it rains, it pours? yep, i've had quite the storm cloud over my head at least that's what it felt like! also not gonna lie, i let it last way too long! yesterday morning i shifted my mindset. the work days are still long... i still find myself being more emotional than i usually am... times are still stressful... but, i'm learning to control the controllable. every day i can choose my mindset. every day i can choose to exercise not just for my physical health, but my emotional health as well! every day i can choose to fuel my body with healthy, whole foods. what are you choosing to control during these crazy times? true or false... being stuck inside during a global health crisis without access to a gym or to specific fresh foods every day will definitely cost you progress and throw you off track. you just can’t get the same quality workout at home. ummm, no!! so false!! not that long ago, that’s exactly what i would have been thinking. but then i was introduced to some of the most incredible home workouts and nutrition programs that i believe exist! my whole transformation has happened in the comfort of my own home! i won't let a little stand in my way! my fitness routine is right where i want it to be, and i won't take that for granted!!!! i had every excuse in the book, but they definitely didn’t feel like excuses!! i really was busy. i really didn’t think i’d ever be that skinny girl, so working out wasn’t worth the effort. well guess what, i’m still not “that skinny girl” but i’m “that strong girl” and my body has blown me away with how it can change, and what it’s capable of!!! i love it now more than ever… and i feel pretty. damn. good! lying to ourselves only hurts us… because excuses are a false comfort. don’t hate me….!! i’m just here to share my journey with anyone who can relate and wants to be on the other side of food and body freedom with me!!! if your radar is going off, let’s talk! today i should have been up and on my way to see my team. today is our quarterly coaching event. however, is keeping us apart. but that won't stop us! even though we won't be in the same location physically, we will be together virtually. i can't wait to “see” my teammates and to learn and grow together! i'm sure there will be some exciting announcements as well! if lack of community is something that you're missing out on right now, we have the perfect opportunity for you!!! starting monday my team will be hosting a 5 day information session on how to monetize your social media as a health and wellness coach. what you'll get: 10 different workouts to try! week long meal plan! free business training so you can start to understand how you can build a business with no prior social media experience! a glimpse into what a day in the life of a coach looks like! an online community so you can meet the team and understand how we function together while working from home! 5 days of inspiration and dipping your toes into something that could change your life!!! nothing to lose and so much to gain! sound like something you'd be interested in? let's chat! oh. my. goodness. i am definitely not high maintenance, but it is time! i need a hair cut so bad! those who have naturally curly hair will completely get where i'm coming from! as my curly hair grows, it gets weighed down and the curls don't bounce as much as when my hair is shorter. therefore, when it grows out, the shape of my haircut changes drastically. and right now it's in that triangle stage. so that's that. anybody else?? i guess that's the good thing about having to wear a mask all day every day....i don't want my hair down anyway! trying for the 29th time today not to binge on the chips calling your name??? with our routines being thrown off by covid19 and grocery runs becoming a whoooole new experience, it can be hard to stay on track and be consistent!!! believe me, when a craving hits me now, i’m relying on my prep work more than everrrr before… i need something that is quick, is satisfying, is jam-packed full of protein and nutrients, and lasts well in the fridge!!! these little chocolate protein bombs are the bomb!! and?!?! no baking required!! let me know if you want the recipe delivered to your inbox!!!! what’s up?!?! you might want in on this! here’s how you’ll know: are you self-driven when it comes to things you love?? does your soul sing when you help improve people’s lives?? does the idea of additional purpose and belonging that lets you work just in the cracks of your day sound right up your busy alley?? then heyyy new friend!!! seriously though, if you value health and fitness and are curious about any of this, i want to talk with you because you won’t regret giving it a shot. i didn’t, and have yet to find someone who did!! drop me a message and let's chat!!! quick quiz! what…. improves sleep quality? helps psychological and mental health? helps raise positivity and feelings of optimism? boosts energy?? it’s been proven! fights and lowers emotions that are toxic for the body like regret, anger, resentment, jealousy… did you guess gratitude?? it’s that powerful. wow. our mindset is a big deal, my friends. i’ve committed myself to catching every negative thought and replacing it with something i’m thankful for. the results are like a positivity magnet. have you practiced this?? what benefits have you noticed?? technically i'm working today, however, lucky for me! it hasn't been busy...now i'm knocking on wood, hoping it stays that way through the night! i haven't gotten much of anything done around the house which i am totally ok with!. i haven't been outside because it looks like the middle of a snow globe! so what have i done today? snuggled under a blanket and watched a few movies! favorite so far a dog's purpose! so cute! what are you doing to unwind today?? trying to eat healthy while social-distancing, instead of stocking up on junky processed foods and spam like the world is ending?? yeah, me too! i've been getting a little more creative in the kitchen and see a lot of you with extra help from the kids! meaning a lot more patience and clean up for you moms…! i’ve got eleven recipes ready to go that are not only a huge hit with the kids, but the kids can “help” make them with their freshly washed hands. they love getting their hands messy and are more likely to try new things if they've had a hand in making it! win-win! i personally can't wait to try the sweet potato pizza bites! ok, ready? all you have to do is click the link in my profile, follow the steps, and the recipes are all yours! “if one lights a fire for others, one will brighten one’s own way.” nichirin preach it!!! i love what i do… and can’t help but wake up and feel blessed every stinkin’ day. my cup is full. what fills your cup?? i used to think staying fit and eating healthy food was too expensive. i’d see “organic” labels and fancy gyms and think “nope.” not for me. i thought i was too busy to workout every single day. that long trips to the gym were a luxury i couldn’t afford. i didn’t think good nutrition was possible for me, ‘cause i’d get off track and fall off the wagon every single time i tried to stay consistent. sound familiar at all??? if i wasn’t eating and working out strictly and perfectly every single day, i’d binge and say screw it, and go off the rails! that cycle got reeeaal old and disheartening over the years.. we all have our reasons for not trying new things. for me, the source of my inconsistency was linked to the time lost in trying to figure out what to do, and my “perfectionism”. there has never been another time where i’ve been more thankful for my ability to get in a killer workout right at home, on my own schedule, and have a nutrition plan all laid out for me that doesn’t require constant trips for fresh food at the grocery store when we’re supposed to be social distancing!!! if you’re like “whaaat???” then holler at me!!!!!!! tough thoughts ahead... have you ever realized someone you love isn’t growing with you? like doing life with that person just makes you feel like you’re not going anywhere? i mean anyone from those long time friends, old mentors, people you love and used to look up to. it’s a really hard thing to navigate, cause it’s not like they’re “bad”! they might have great intentions and be good people. but are they a good influence on your dreams? is following their example getting you nowhere? you have permission to choose who influences your dreams. if the people around you aren’t living the life you want, find the ones who are because it will push you too! your dreams and goals are too big! you don’t have time to waste!! i hate cliffhangers and vague stories so i’m here to get real straight cause y’all have had some real questions: how do i get paid to workout?! a lot easier than you’d think! as slowly or quickly as i want, i can look over all the nutrition and workout programs and test it out!! meal plans… performance products… all of it!!! it’s like a netflix of workouts. and it’s my job to know it. definitely doesn’t suck!! were you already a fitness expert when you started? nope but i got there over time when i was ready! it was all at my own pace! i had all the training i could possibly want right at my fingertips… so every step for success was laid out for me. easy peasy. are you working all day long?? no more than the time i was already spending scrolling the socials! lots of us spend at least 1-2 hours a day on insta… you know what i mean?? might as well add some purpose to it!! if you want to get paid to stay fit and my fave part here see others reach their goals and transform their lives, this coaching thing is made for you!!! it fills my soul like crazy and is soooo fulfilling! send me a message and let’s chat more to see if this is for you! what is something you’ve re-discovered in the last few weeks, that you wouldn’t have taken the time to dive into or do if you hadn’t been stuck at home all this time? arts and crafts? have you seen love this! actually using your phone to call someone or facetime them? enjoying a good book? writing letters or messages of hope to others? despite still working full time, i've been working on a puzzle! it's one of those crazy ones with no border pieces, no picture to go by and 5 extra pieces! it's no wonder it's been set up for a year! i’ve also played backgammon with my mom twice in the last few days! i am definitely grateful for all the notes and messages of hope i've received. i am grateful for those who know how to sew and are making masks for those at risk. i am grateful for the free time that i do have and giving myself the grace to just be. so i just want to take a minute to remind you to enjoy this time you have and to thank you for being you! if a big risk doesn’t scare you at least a little bit, you might be crazy, and you might not be dreaming big enough! fear is a natural instinct, we just shouldn’t allow it to make our decisions. fear said i shouldn’t learn to ride a bike. fear said i shouldn’t open my heart to love again after getting it broken. fear said i shouldn’t invest in my fitness and try something new. fear said i shouldn't chase my dream of helping others workout for a living. well, we all know now that fear is a big fat liar. so, how would you treat friends that lied to you the way your fears do? get. rid. of. them! what is waiting for you on the other side? i'm not going to lie...i'm a little bit jealous. jealous of those who are working from home or currently furloughed. like really? i could be sitting home getting paid to do nothing? disclaimer i work for a pretty amazing company who has guaranteed pay to their employees through april 28th! instead... as i get ready for work each morning i hear how quiet the neighborhood is. as i drive to work i see primarily semis and other business trucks. as i go about my day i watch so many out enjoying a nice walk. as i come home from work to a not so clean house i think of all the things i could have done if i was home. as i sit here at home on my day off i find myself not wanting to do anything because i need to rest and refresh, knowing that i still have to go to work again next week. but i also know that many of you have no source of income right now. many of you are dealing with the difficulties of working from home. many of you are learning how to home school your children. many of you are having to get by with less. heck, some of you might just be learning to cook! i am essential. i am humbled. i am blessed. and i am also here for you. health and wellness coaching has been a part of my life for some time now. not only is it a source of income my fun money, but it's so much about the community. we are here for each other. we support each other through

time. it’s a recipe for burnout! those small, daily decisions are what takes us the distance… like getting up a liiiiittle earlier to get some time for ourselves before the rest of the house wakes up. or taking extra sips of water throughout the day as soon as we think of it. adding a little more green and color to one meal at a time. approaching this whole self-distancing thing just one day at a

saturday? yoga and meditation. even if it’s just getting quiet just for a few minutes! there are some great online resources for meditation!!! have you tried any of them?? my personal favorite is the calm app! surviving and thriving! i definitely used to think a gym for 1-2 hoursday and a big trainer budget was what was required to get fit. i’ve never been so glad to be sooo wrong on every point. especially the no-gym part!!!! thank goodness, especially right now!! i forgot to mention i didn’t think working out could be fun either…. to a netflix of workouts and feeling our best right from

you are trying to navigate home schooling. many of you are essential employees still going to work daily but working on a new way. because i am an essential employee, at first, i didn't really feel like my life was changing too much. but in reality, my job is changing on a daily, sometimes hourly basis. as a hospice nurse i am not always allowed to see my patients in person. we are doing more and more telephone visits. families are not always wanting us in their homes to limit their own exposure. our families we serve are struggling with not being able to visit their loved ones who are in the final stages of life. i have to take my temperature twice daily for my employer and every time i enter a care facility. i am being asked what my prior jobs have consisted of in case they need to pull us from our roles to help in the hospitals. they now recommend we wear scrubs instead of business casual. glad i saved them! today i was fit tested for an n95. what's really tough is that these patients need our support! they are some of the sickest people in our communities, however, that also makes them very high risk. it can be so overwhelming when i really stop and think about it! one thing that i've found comfort in amongst the chaos is trying to keep to a routine as much as possible. i find that if i start and end my day with a solid routine, life feels just a little more normal. i feel just a little more in control. i don't know what each day will bring in the coming weeks. but i know that i controlling the few things i can will help me through. so if you can control nothing else. take a minute to think how you can book end your days with a solid routine. it many just help bring you a little bit of peace. and if you’re looking for something to keep your kids busy, write some letters to the residents of nursing homes! don't forget to grab my free pdf on tips to use when feeling overwhelmed! need some hand sanitizer at home and dreading a trip to the store or they’re

communities working together in a whole new way. it’s times like these that my gratitude for my online fitness tribe of women has deepened to another level! how have you kept up your fitness routine at home?? looking for some workout ideas? i'm here for you! my mentality was always: if i skipped my workout, no one else would know. i mean who else really cares? i struggled with finding the motivation to get in shape and i was starting to feel like i would never get back to my self. and then i found a community of women who cared if i showed up, who looked out for me and encouraged me, who knew exactly what i needed workouts i could do from home, virtual accountability from women just like me and all of this done is less than 30 minutes per day this community gave me life-long friends that don’t even live in my hometown. i'm so grateful to have so much support from so many women who are just like me. and we all deserve to feel like we have women in our corner and if your radar is going off because you've been waiting for something exactly like this, let's talk. feeling overwhelmed? we are all experiencing the world a little different these days. this morning i threw together a little information about what to do if you’re feeling overwhelmed. grab it here: https:gooole81.wixsite.comoverwhelmed link will also be in my bio! hang in there folks! we will get through this! sometimes, we save all of our kindness for others. we give others our best. and save what's left over for ourselves. the unkind words. the unfair statements. the negative self-talk. and maybe, we're really the ones that we need to be most kind to. because kindness only breeds more kindness. and isn't that really what this world needs? has your worry turned disruptive? this was something that our team chaplain shared with us this week...and i definitely think we could all benefit from hearing it! limit exposure to news media. avoid staying up late to monitor the news. when you do look at the news, be sure to seek out reputable sources. being that i'm a nurse, i am trying to avoid most all news related to this virus. i am not ignoring it by any means. but i am lucky enough to work for a world renowned health care system that is openly communicating changes as they happen. i do not need to expose myself to any more information than that. connect with friends and family for support via social media or phone. i've found such support through my friends and family and it is definitely such a good distraction from what is going on in the world. they probably are looking for the support just as much as you are! meditate, stretch or practice deep breathing. i personally like to center myself first thing in the morning. i spend time reading my devotion and other books to improve my mindset. it really starts the day off on the right foot. i also find that throughout the day i'm telling myself and sometimes others to just stop and take a deep breath! do activities you enjoy. although you may not be able to take in your usual activities, maybe you can find something new to enjoy? honestly, i'm really looking forward to a weekend at home with nothing that i have to do! be optimistic. remind yourself that even these strong feelings will fade. better times will come. they always do. so just sit for a moment and think about all you have to be grateful for and what this lesson is teaching you. this has always helped me so much in the past! eat a healthy diet. get some exercise. avoid turning to drugs or alcohol to cope. now is not the time to become a couch potato! fueling your mind and body with healthy foods and exercise will help to keep you healthy! who wants to sit around all day feeling like garbage from eating all the junk? i know i'm motivated more than ever right now to exercise daily and eat whole, healthy foods! how are you coping? yesterday happened to be certified nurses day! with all that is currently going on in the world i didn’t even notice. but as i checked my email at the end of the day i saw a nice little token on appreciation sitting there from my boss! just a simple, online recognition of my certification thanking me for my dedication and service. for making a difference in my patients and their families lives. it may not be much to some, but to me it meant a lot. seriously. someone took time out of their own busy day to recognize me for what i’m out there doing. so in these times of uncertainty i urge you to reach out to others. you might just make their day. it might be just what they need at that moment. i know i plan to do the same! so to all my certified nursing friends out there, happy belated certified nursing day! today marks 47 years since my grandfather passed away. unfortunately i never met the man. but today has always been a day i've remembered in my family. how do i remember this when i wasn't even born yet? first off, my mom has always celebrated her parents birthdays and dates of death as she was young when they died as a way to keep their memories alive. it also happens to be the day....that the swallows return to capistrano! to most people this may not mean a lot. however, this is always something that my mom has held close to her heart. her father was actually stationed in riverside, ca when he was in the army during wwii. very near to san juan capistrano. she has very fond memories of her family travels when she was growing up some of them to california to visit others that he had served with. i am so honored to have taken her on this bucket list trip to san juan capistrano last year to witness the swallow festival. something we definitely wouldn't have been able to do this year. timing is everything. sometimes we don't understand the why behind things. i know a lot of people who are having to give up these types of trips. i know people are devastated with what's going on in the world right now. but i believe that everything happens for a reason, as hard as that is to realize. and right now your health and your safety are a good reason! stay safe! stay healthy! what if the secret to success was simply never giving up? think about it...do we give up on babies when they're learning to walk telling them walking isn't for them? nope. we give them time positive encouragement. so no matter how many times you've... tripped and fallen... lost your way... fallen off track... gotten off course... surrendered your passion... forgotten your path... everything you've learned through that process can be applied to the next trial. so learning how to maneuver, how to breathe through failure and how to be compassionate with yourself– these are all skills that need to be practiced with patience. a little time and positive encouragement can go a long way. where could you use a little time and positive encouragement? comment below! today our governor closed down all bars, restaurants, and gyms. tomorrow all schools will close if they haven't already. i'm sure that things are looking similar in your communities or states as well. in this time of social distancing, my team is offering some amazing opportunities to stay connected with others while continuing to focus on your health and wellness. regardless of the need for social distancing we can still keep the social connection strong! our team has been using virtual connection for years and some of the greatest friendships have come from it! we are pumped to get to share that connection with you during this time! no. strings. attached. we will be having virtual open gyms three times daily 5:30-615 am, 6-7 am and 2-3 pm all listed as cst adjust based on where you live.. just hop online via a zoom link and sweat it out with others. you can choose to do whatever type of workout you'd like! if you need help coming up with an at home workout, we will also provide you with access to 14 free at home workouts! so you can either try the 14 different sample workouts or sign up for a free 2 week membership to do whichever program you choose! also included is a free 5 day meal plan recipes and grocery lists included as well as a kids corner for additional healthy, kid friendly recipes including muffins and cookies! it is so important that you and your families continue to focus on a healthy lifestyle even if you can't partake in your usual activities. we are truly a community that helps others! we want to share with you the resources we have to help you make life just a little easier in the coming days. if this is something you'd be interested in, send me a message with your email address and i will send the links right on over! stay strong! stay healthy! we're all in this together! as a nurse i'm in the midst of the covid-19 pandemic. like literally can't get away from it! i am out there doing home visits with some of the most at risk, sickest, most vulnerable people in your communities. the cancellations of large events, the travel bans, the closing of schools and business, the restrictions on visitors to nursing homes, the screenings... they've all been put in place for a reason. am i afraid of getting infected? maybe a little, but not really. i know that i am otherwise a healthy, youngish adult. if i do contract the virus, likely my symptoms would be similar to a common cold. that being said...all these restrictions being put into place are not meant to protect me! they are to protect the elderly. they are to protect the immunocompromised. they are to protect the young children with other serious medical conditions. and part of protecting them is keeping all of us healthy. even though you may be healthy and your symptoms minimal, it can be deadly to those mentioned above. that is the scary part. and no one wants to be the one to bring the virus home to grandma, mom, little sister, etc. so just do what they recommend. stay home as able. avoid the crowds. don't go to work if you are sick. wash your hands you should do this anyway, it's basic hygiene. and for goodness sake quit buying all the damn toilet paper! just my two cents. so, what are you doing to stay healthy? luckily with my background as a nurse and a healthy lifestyle influencer, there's not much i need to change in my daily routine. i continue to wash my hands frequently...for real, just do it! i keep my body fueled with good, wholesome foods and drink my superfoods daily. i exercise my body on a daily basis from the comfort of my own home. i keep my mind occupied with positive, inspirational messages and thoughts. we will get through this! and we will get through this together just not in the literal sense!. i used to pursue happiness...thinking it was something i needed to achieve and acquire... but it wasn't until i realized that happiness showed up when i detached myself from this vicious cycle i'll be happy when... and actually spent time on determining what gave me peace of mind which now includes practicing yoga and meditation to listen to my internal compass, learning to be intuitive and being in the moment. daily personal development through reading. a non-negotiable for me! moving my body for the joy of moving, sweating to increase endorphins and taking time for daily self-care. taking time to feel grateful, reflecting on my blessings and remembering the that made me who i am i love music for this!. what brings you internal peace happiness? sorry i've been so mia lately! i've had such good intentions of adding to my stories, making daily posts, etc. after returning from vacation i really struggled with my mood. and although that is going better, work has been crazy! in the last 4 days i've worked, i've put in 42.25 hours and 31 hours of call. that's 73.25 hours in four days!! so i'm looking forward to my day off tomorrow when i only have to call in for a meeting...and then it will be back to work through the weekend. in the meantime, i've been spending a lot of time focusing on my own personal growth in those few moments before and after work that i'm not sleeping! so bear with me as i navigate my busy schedule. i'm still here. i still care about you all. i'm still helping people reach their health and wellness goals. it just may not be quite as obvious. i will be back to posting on a regular basis again soon! can you... lead a healthy lifestyle get paid for it? help others with their fitness goals while reaching your own goals at the same time? grow a successful business while raising a family, working another job, or starting off small with the end goal being to work from home or anywhere with wifi? travel to fitness events throughout the year where you're surrounded by a community of people who are the heartbeat of positivity? spoiler alert you can! and i'm on a search to find you! i'm looking for women that want to be mentored and want to learn how to earn a living by working on their fitness!! if the points above describe your and drop an emoji or gif and let's chat! boxing is one of the best total-body workouts you can do… but i’ll be honest, i’ve always felt intimidated by the idea of going into a boxing gym and actually trying it. but i’ve got some good news one of my favorite super trainers is launching a new program this spring!! this 6 week program is built around the simple, precise, and effective principles of boxing without any of the impact!. that means all you need is weights and resistance bands. each week has 5 workouts: 3 of the days are boxing training and the other 2 are strength training workouts. the boxing workouts are broken up into 10 rounds, 3 minutes each meaning workouts are 40 minutes or less! you’ll focus on punching combos and footwork that progress over the 6 weeks of the program! as if boxing isn't core work in itself, the last round will always be core specific. i know i can use help in this area! one of the cool things about this program is that it’s being shot on the road! each week features a new city with new workouts filmed in select, iconic boxing gyms and locations around the country! i think this is going to add such a fun twist to this program!! today i tried the sample workout. i definitely felt so uncoordinated! but it was fun and it went by so fast! i'd love to get you hooked up with the vip early access! if you'd like to try the sample workout, drop me a message including your email so i can send it your way! maybe you tell yourself when i have more time.. when i feel more motivated... when the weather changes... when i'm fitter... and i'm going to be super real for a minute.... without dreams and goals there is no living, only merely existing, and that is not why we are here. {-mark twain} but i'm not going to hide anything. i've been living those lies for the last week! i've really been struggling since returning home from vacation. i've been working long hours. i've been in a rough mood. i keep telling myself tomorrow i will get back on track. tomorrow i will reign in my nutrition. tomorrow i will get a workout it. {maybe you noticed i've been mia?!} tomorrow came and went...came and went...came and went... no more! i am going all in and returning to the program i completed prior to vacation. starting tomorrow! no ifs, ands, or buts! so if your radar is going off and you've been thinking about taking action on those fitness goals and dreams, this message is for you!! let's start living! what if you really had what it takes? {because you do}. and you believed that from the bottom of your heart? who might you become? all women are not whole. all women are not broken. we are who we are regardless of how others are willing to accept us. never be ashamed of your truth. -reyna biddy love yourself a little more today and everyday a little compassion will change the world. tag a gal pal you love and may need to hear this today! geeeezzzz. well, when you put it that way... learning to walk was exhausting. learning to ride a bike was difficult. learning to get over a broken heart was tough. learning to love after being hurt was painful. learning to love myself wasn't easy. but all of it has been worth it. tag a friend who has made your journey just a little bit easier. yes i drink beer and don't count calories. yes i eat cake, taste-test cookies and don't turn down dessert. yes i get my workouts in consistently, even when i'm on vacation because i believe in and even when it hurts. and i do all of this because i believe in and not taking myself too seriously. because i love to have fun with my friends and family and i don't want to be the type of person that doesn't eat birthday cake. because my value isn't determined by the weight on the scale, the gap between my thighs or the size in the back of my pants. and the only way to challenge that belief is to against it. to spread the message that these limiting beliefs against women are bs. and if you hold these same beliefs, we are future besties. you know...fighting against negative body images, challenging the beliefs that women need to take up less space and fighting back for the freedom we deserve. double tap if you agree! it's super easy to get lost in the journey. to focus on how far you have to go, how many times you've failed, how many times you've had to start over or how many times you've given up. but nothing positive lives in negative self-talk that leaves you feeling powerless, beat-up and deflated. believe me today i completed another program. only 3 lbs and 2.75 inches lost. but take a look at that second picture. the pink is when i used lighter weights than the week before. the yellow is the same weight and the green is heavier! i’m taking that small win. so let's rephrase that voice that tends to be an you have a big goal and you're scared af? no problem. everyone starts somewhere and you can accomplish whatever you put your mind to you fell off the wagon? cool. you were courageous enough to get on the track and for that, you should be so damn proud. you gained some weight back? c'est la vie! i'm glad you enjoyed that wine and french bread while in france as you should! you know exactly what to do to get back at it and you're ahead of anyone else that hasn't tried. the good habits are there ready to be reignited. you aren't feeling motivated? you're a living breathing human! yay you! this feeling will come up again so the best way to strategize is to anticipate that this day will show up and be ready for it. so try mixing it up, try something new and remember to be compassionate and caring with yourself along the way. the journey to success isn't a direct line. and the most successful people are the most resilient...they've failed the most times, made the most mistakes, and gotten up every time. if you want to start your journey but don't know where to begin, i'm here to help. and in the meantime, let's try to look at failure as progress...steps in the right direction..moves towards making lasting changes and giving ourselves the empathy we deserve when we need a little breathing room to get there. maybe you tell yourself when i have more time.. when i feel more motivated... when the weather changes... when i'm fitter... and i'm going to be super real for a minute.... without dream and goals there is no living, only merely existing, and that is not why we are here. {-mark twain} so if your radar is going off and you've been thinking about taking action on those health goals and dreams, this message is for you!! drop an emoji and let's start living! you guys! i have been in vacation mode for the last month! and now it's just a few days away! so excited! nursing is such a huge part of my life. nothing like putting in 24 hours of work and 31 hours of call the last 3 days before vacation! just one more day to go! one thing i learned early on in my career was that self-care is so important. like they say, you can't pour from an empty cup. so make sure you fill your cup first. it is not selfish at all! so take a step back. find something that fuels you. something that fills your cup. only then will you be able to be the best version of you when you're helping others! what if your exercise journey was really about getting your body to feel how it was designed to feel? {full of energy, vitality, life like it was meant to move? we're not designed to live in pain or with limitations, dysfunction, chronic stress, anxiety, fear… our bodies, nor our lives, are meant to “go downhill”. yet so many of us are left to feel like we're supposed to slow down thinking it's natural to feel this way. well, my friend, there is another way. exercise has 1001 benefits but feeling better is 100 the main reason why it's become a part of my routine. if you've been thinking about wanting to feel better, drop an emoji and let's chat. we're future besties if... you always say yes!! a last minute spa weekend? matching workout tanks? a business idea that seems too good to be you always go like a boss! you don't count calories. you appreciate all the food groups being it's own category! and you never pass up a great night out for a diet. you because it makes you sane. you love to workout and would never pass up a hike, spin class or group workout with your besties. it's a way of life and you wouldn't trade it for anything. if this sounds like you, we're future besties and i'd love for you to introduce yourself! like this post if this sounds like you cause you can never have enough girlfriends!!! as i introduced myself in my accountability group this month i told them that i've been a hospice nurse for 10 years! wait, what?! my anniversary totally passed by without me remembering this year! i have only been a nurse for almost 16 years. and now, just like that, i've spent 10 years in end of life care! when i tell people i work in hospice the automatic response is that must be so hard. but you know what? there isn't a nursing job that isn't hard! ask any nurse you know... the job isn't easy. but to a nurse, it's worth it. we thrive by caring for others. for helping them through the hard times. for lending an ear or a shoulder to cry on. for giving our all every single day in order to make someone else's day just a little bit better. and to most nurses, it's not a just a job either. it's a passion. we do what we do because it is what we are called to do. so to all my nurse friends who may be having a hard day. stay strong. stay positive. keep doing the good work that you do. it does not go unnoticed! perfectionism had me measuring everything. being a perfectionist meant i measured my calories, my weight, my worth by how disciplined i could be. the truth is, i wanted to make peace with my body. it wasn't until i started on my own fitness journey surrounded by a community of supportive cheerleaders that i finally realized how to let go of unhealthy habits. and the mindset shift came from pushing myself physically, being proud of what my body could do, how strong i was getting and somehow everything i had been measuring didn't matter anymore. the most amazing part? i didn't have to workout 6-7 days per week. and it feels much more balanced than anything else i have tried before. so if you've been thinking about doing something different and know the root cause is finding balance finding peace with your body {and you're sick of the perfectionism and self-sabotage}, let's chat! drop and emoji to learn more!! the other day in my stories i made a comment that things have been hard lately. i'm not saying things like this for pity. i'm not using this as an excuse. it is my truth and i know that there are others out there dealing with the same types of things. dealing with chronic illness andor autoimmune disorders is not for the faint of heart. lately i've been spending 11-12 hours a night in bed and occasionally taking a nap during the day too. my hair is falling out by the handful. my skin is dry, flaky, itchy and breaking out. my hands and arms often go numb. i have trouble concentrating and remembering. like today...totally forgot to pick up my new dose of medication. my next doctor appointment wasn't until march but i decided to go in and get my labs drawn early. while i thought my levels would be off the chart high, they were off the chart low! neither is good, enter the crumminess. so i heard from the doctor and they are adjusting my medications. there is no quick fix. it'll take 6 weeks until they retest my levels. so until then, i'll listen to my body, rest as needed, and just do my best. after all, that's all we can really do, right? don’t ever give up. don’t ever give in. keep up the good fight! calling all the ladies out there that deserve some love appreciation!!! if you're feeling tired, run-down and a need to nourish your body and take care of yourself this is for you!! you'll feel younger, more energetic and more confidence when you're invested in your health. this is a gift that keeps on giving!!! i'll set you up with the exact tools that started me on my health and fitness journey... the same meal plan, containers tools that i used to start my journey. including a super easy simple plan to follow!! the identical workouts that transformed me to become my best– a whole year of them, all that you can do from the comfort of your home!! a month's supply of nutritional supplements that helped stop cravings, upped all of my nutrients and kept me feeling energized all day long! a month of accountability, support, and coaching by someone who has been there done it and certainly has the t-shirt! tag a friend who may need this in their life too! let's do this together! take care of yourself first. “don't rely on someone else for your happiness and self-worth. only you can be responsible for that. if you can't love and respect yourself no one else will be able to make that happen. accept who you are completely; the good and the bad and make changes as you see fit not because you think someone else wants you to be different.” -stacey charter like if you agree!!! a letter to my younger self, and to all the women out there that may just need to hear this today... make no mistake, you're a once-in-a-lifetime event in the universe and what you have to contribute matters. don't let anyone tell you anything different. you were born to contribute and create. find something that lights your soul on fire and keep working at it until someone pays you to do it. most people don't take action on their dreams because they're too afraid to make a commitment to what they really want. don't be afraid to go after whatever it is you really want. you may fail at things you try but celebrate the effort and not just the end result. this is where growth and magic happens. action→ experience→ wisdom don't worry about getting it perfect, just get it going. what advice would you give to your younger self? comment below you will be too much for some people. those aren't your people. it's not you, it's them. there are people for whom your too much will be exactly enough. don't become less. find those who want more. never apologize for being you, defending your journey, sharing your honesty and saying no. never apologize for walking away from ultimatums, judgment, unfounded gossip, martyrdom, or other vibes. and when you do all of these things, living your life in the most robust truth, and other people can’t stand what it does to them…stand firm. love yourself anyway. your tribe will find you, as you are meant to find them. let's face it. i am always looking for the easy way to do things... i've spent hundreds of dollars on losing weight quick plans that would guarantee quick results but i would just end up hungry. i'd base how i felt about myself on what the scale said and then be upset when i didn't see the results. because i was always in full control or no control! i realized this formula wasn't working and i was actually spending a ton of money on things that weren't helping me in the long run. i needed to find something that... didn't have me counting calories or making me feel deprived. i needed a plan that was fit for a foodie. was worth the investment and would include more than just a low calorie magical diet or pill. i needed accountability, support and more to look forward to than just weighing myself every day. a plan that was a lifestyle and not a diet. what i'd been doing wasn't working. i needed a fresh approach and to learn from someone who'd actually made a transformation themselves. and it's been a 180 learning how to nourish my body, invest in something that taught me life skills, and helped me transition my entire life. i'm excited to share my journey and if your radar is going off because you've been waiting for something exactly like this, let's talk! these are the 5 thoughts that need to go away... you think to yourself... i'll be happy when i finally lose that 15lbs... i'll be confident when i get back into my skinny jeans... i'll be less stressed when i am back to my goal weight... i'll love myself more when i am lbs on the scale... i look better in a bathing suit or naked when i'm smaller... k...i'm going to be super real for a minute and don't hate me there's no better time to love yourself than right this minute. because you get back what you give yourself. and when you radiate love, that love radiates back to you. and when you start to shift that feeling of self-hate to self-love, and stay focused on being your best self, that's where peace starts to make its way in. and that, my friend, is a beautiful thing! and the secret sauce to loving your body is to work it hard, love it hard and cheer for it the loudest. so if you're ready to discover your greatness, unlock your potential and put that body to work, i’m ready to help to be on your team, build you up and cheer for you the loudest. if your instincts are going off and you've been thinking way too damn hard and long about this this is for you and a sign to take action!! send me a dm and let’s chat!!!! i heard on the radio the other day that on super bowl sunday, people will be offered 19 different foods and consume 11,000 calories! that doesn't even include any beverages you may consume! like, wow! don't let one day, or a few hours for that matter, throw you off your game. stay hydrated water first it will keep your stomach full therefore making you less hungry! eat the veggies for real! they're very filling and again will keep you from reaching for so many of the less healthy snacks! going to a party? eat before you go!! that way you won't show up famished and eat all the things! better yet? bring your own healthy addition to the spread. that way you at least know you'll have something healthy to turn to! if you're going to consume adult beverages, drink a full glass of water in between each beverage. this will cut back on how much alcohol you consume and also keep you hydrated! things don't go as planned and you fall off the wagon? no worries! just make sure you hop right back on monday morning! 11,000 calories....i'm still in awe of that number. like how is that even possible?! mind blown... are you watching the game today? who are you rooting for? today i spent the afternoon with my legion family. there is not a better feeling in the world than giving back to your community! what ways do you like to serve your community? i truly believe that we have the power to chose our destiny. and that this lies within the average of the 5 people we spend the most time with. we need people whether it’s mentors, coaches, family or friends who will challenge us and make us better. so i try to surround myself with those that can run circles around me in as many areas as possible and people who are exponentially better in a variety of ways. because this forces me to grow and to push to be a better version of myself and knowing that i've been selective in my crew consciously allows me to choose a better version of my future self. who are your people? it’s hard to remember a time when i wasn't trying to lose weight. i would be strict, never miss a workout or an off plan meal and end up in constant failure because i couldn't adhere to the guidelines. and i had always thought it was me. that i wasn't disciplined enough. that i needed to be more strict with myself. that i was a failure because obviously other people could do it. and after i failed numerous times, i was finally lucky enough to find a coach that helped me see that if the plan isn't working, you change the plan. you start with what works for you and build the plan around it and not the other way around. and what i learned is there are plans out there that are designed for real life {and perfect for your needs}. workouts that are only 30 minutes long. 4 days a week. perfect workouts for busy people and those that become bored easily like me!. workouts that can have you seeing results in 8 weeks without giving up everything you love. plans that still involve being able to have chocolate and wine. so if you've been stuck on finding the right plan for you, don't give up. it's not you. it's the plan. and something better exists right around the corner. best of all? i'm here for you! now signing folks up for my february accountability group! message me for more info! need to supercharge your morning routine?!! this podcast is everything!! have you heard of rachel hollis? i was lucky enough to hear her speak in person last july...so inspirational! you have to choose what you want and need in your life. rocking a morning routine is so valuable! it starts with getting some sleep! in order to have energy to do what you need to do on any given day, you must be well rested. don't hit snooze! you're breaking a promise you made to yourself before you even open your eyes. damn! get up an hour before you usually do to focus on you! center yourself and ground yourself in who you are! the rest of the day you are able to show up for other people. the morning routine is about you! move your body enough to make a sweat! if you own your morning, you own your day! tag someone that loves podcasts and is always looking for more to listen to!! link is in the comments! the thing is… you are enough. you are more than enough, and you always have been. the world wants you to believe that there is something wrong with you. that you have to buy this product and that product. that there is a “magical product that will solve all your problems. that overnight success is real. no, no, and no. there is nothing wrong with you, and there is not a product out there that will do a quick fix on your life. you have to work at improving your own life. day in and day out. over and over again. molly ho our minds aren’t designed to make us happy. we’re designed to look for danger and threats to protect ourselves. that’s why it’s so important to find rituals that remind us why we’re grateful and take us out of being fearful. these rituals allow us to quiet the mind and listen to our thoughts so we can squash the negative ones. tony robbins is the master at teaching this. he discusses why daily rituals of moving and breathing, gratitude and exercise and visualization all help pull us out of fear and scarcity. what activities do you choose when negative thoughts creep in? comment below what if your exercise journey was really about getting your body to feel how it was designed to feel? full of energy, vitality, life like it was meant to move? we're not designed to live in pain or with limitations, dysfunction, chronic stress, anxiety, fear… our bodies, nor our lives, are meant to “go downhill”. yet so many of us are left to feel like we're supposed to slow down thinking it's natural to feel this way. well, my friend, there is another way. exercise has 1001 benefits but feeling better is 1000 the main reason why it's become a part of my routine. if you've been thinking about wanting to feel better, drop an emoji or send a dm and let's chat. if it costs you your peace, it's too expensive. give up the things that cause you stress. give up the things that keep you up at night. cultivate the things that make you actually happy. enjoy the moments of peace that get scarcer and scarcer as we get older. spend your time wisely, don't funnel all your cash into things that don't make you more content because of it. if what makes you happy is doing things that create memories that you'll look back on, do it. if it costs you your peace, it's too expensive. -heya emily to move forward, we have to give back. oprah winfrey it's all about helping those that need us the most. because someone helped us when we needed them too. and that's why sisterhoods are the best. i'm kind of sad today because all my fellow coaches are at an event. i so wanted to attend, but after the week i've had i knew it wasn't going to happen. but i also know there will be another opportunity soon! this pic is a throwback to my very first coaching event last january. these girls mean so much to me whether they're aware or not! and i can't wait until the day that you all get to experience this too! they announced some of the details of our april 17th event...i can’t wait!! are you looking for an uplifting, supportive community with whom you share common goals? let's chat! i've learned the magical art of not being so hard on myself. because it was always the guilt that would push me into a negative downward spiral that really served no purpose. i've learned to laugh a little more even at myself!, care a little less in a good way and be okay with being more of myself not just trying to make everyone happy. and it just so happens that this has done me a lot of good. a little more self-compassion goes a long way. remember to give yourself a break, i mean the mom in et had an alien living in her house for days and didn't notice! glad to be feeling more like a human being today! hope you all have a great weekend! hey there! did you miss me? just wanted to pop in since i've been pretty quiet over the last few days. unfortunately on monday i started to notice an irritated area of skin which quickly developed into an infection resulting in an abscess. yay me! so to the doctor on tuesday to have it drained i'll spare you the gross details! and get antibiotics. easy peasy, right? nope. had a horrible reactions to the antibiotic like check everything off the list! yay me again! so today i got a new antibiotic. so i shower up and drive to town to the pharmacy. great! just kidding. insurance won't cover it but the pharmacy will gladly call the provider now that i've come in even though they knew 4 hours ago.... smh... i finally get a message that my medication is ready. it's the same damn drug that my insurance wouldn't pay for 4 hours ago.... ha! i'm laughing now so i don't go crazy! so, there you have it! i haven't been able to work out. my nutrition has not been top notch. i’ve been home from work. but i know there are better days to come! hopefully i tolerate the new antibiotic and can get back to a routine soon. all this sitting and lying around is enough to drive someone nuts! just this week i saw a post from one of my friends which just broke my heart! so i thought i'd give you all the same pep talk! your worth is not something someone else can determine for you. that feeling of value must come from within. and when you realize you're true worth, you realize it has never had anything to do with external factors or others opinions. it's an inner peace that comes with knowing that you're worthy no matter what. so know your worth and then add tax! tag someone that may need to hear this today. i know i sure did! you guys! i can not say enough about these shakes i drink daily! on a typical day i drink my shake for breakfast especially when i'm running out the door for work! so quick and easy perfect in my opinion! but they are so tasty that i sometimes use them as a snack or an after dinner treat! just like tonight! had vegetable soup with no protein. so using my shake to fill in the gaps! they keep me full and satisfied. they help curb that awful sweet tooth. and they keep me regular! tmi? sorry there's more to come on that in a minute! they are so much more than just a protein shake. the ingredient of the day: chicory fiber! chicory fiber is a natural, soluble fiber. it allows for sugar, fat and calorie reduction while providing great taste and texture attributes. it is high in inulin which is a prebiotic and can provide a host of digestive and general health benefits. it aids in keeping you regular and scores a zero on the glycemic index. i'm just going to leave this here: if there’s one thing that i may tell you, let it be: you are your home. your body is the only house that you will ever truly own. maybe it’s got some broken windows and there are tear-stains on the floors, maybe you lock the things you wish you weren’t behind it’s many doors. but there is wisdom on its bookshelves, and a laugh to light the rooms, there’s a vase upon the table where the love you’ve grown all blooms. dreams sit on the mantelpiece, next to kindness and your trust, where you use them all so often they have no time to collect dust. so please don’t look at mansions with that envy in your eyes, there’s more that makes a home than its appearance or its size. your body is your shelter, so you deserve to love it all, don’t let the world stand round outside and tell you how to paint your walls. how lucky that you have somewhere to protect you from the night, and if there’s cracks left from the past? well then they just let in more light. poem by @thepoeticunderground you are your only limit! i used to try to workout on my own. i mean not really. i didn't have a clue what i was doing. an occasional walk outside or on the treadmill was about the extent of it because i was too scared to go to the gym! i was inconsistent, lacked community and longed for the support i didn't even know existed. and i never really believed working out could become a positive space because it always seemed like a struggle on my own! but all of this changed when i was finally lucky enough to find a workout coach and my life changed with the community i was introduced to! not only did i reach new levels in my own fitness, but i also found a passion i never knew i had! my coach taught me... helping people with their workouts was actually something i was destined to do! i am a nurse by day and i was born to help others! working out doesn't have to be painful. it doesn't have to be a punishment. it can be about falling in love with your body for everything it can do {and i was never a workout junkie before this!}. i love that i can now help people fall in with fitness. having a sisterhood of women who encourage and support each other is the key to my success and consistency. i don't show up for just me anymore. i show up for my and helping other women stay committed to themselves. so if you've been thinking about trying something new, you love helping people, and fitness is a part of your life, drop an emoji and let's chat! ready to start the year off right? check out these tips to set you on the path to success! 1. start by setting three goals for health, financial and relationships. 2. get yourself a calendar, the one with hourly blocks is great, but any will do. use it to time block the important things that will help you with your health and fitness journey. time block important items related to your goals- i.e. your workout, meal planning, family time. 3. create a morning routine. get up an hour earlier. choose a gratitude practice, do some personal development, meditate and get a workout in before heading to work. 4. make your bed every morning. if you make your bed every morning, you will have accomplished the first task of the day. it will give you a small sense of pride, and it will encourage you to complete the other tasks you have set for the day. 5. set a sleep schedule. to feel your best you need to get adequate sleep. go to bed early and get up early. 6. get yourself a good water bottle. every day you should be drinking half your body weight in ounces. aim for that or more each day. 7. sit down once a week to meal plan. you don't have to prep it all in one day, but knowing what you will be eating each day will prevent you from making bad choices and takes out the guesswork. it also makes grocery shopping much easier. 8. make time for self-care each week and schedule it in your calendar. you can't take care of everyone else if you don't take care of yourself first. go for a massage, make a nail appointment, get your hair done, take a walk. 9. make time for relationships. don't forget to schedule date nights, family time and lunch with friends. it's important to step away from the obligations sometimes to rejuvenate the soul and reconnect with others. 10. personal development. if you are going to be successful, you are going to need to work on your mindset. the best way to do this is with pd. choose a book or podcast and you can even listen to it on your way to work. here's to 2020 being your best year yet!!! i've been pretty quiet today on social media. why? historically new year's eve has been a difficult day for me. for the last three years nothing good has happened on this day. unfortunately today started out the same way. but i know that it will end differently!! going to keep it low key tonight at home by myself. will be scrolling social to see what you're all up to! hope you all have a blast celebrating and remember to stay safe!! not sure if i'll make it until midnight, so just wanted to pop in and say happy new year everyone!! i am positive that 2020 will be the best year ever! are you a resolution maker? the end of the year is approaching fast! a lot of you are probably looking back over the last year and reevaluating your goals. heck, maybe even life in general! some goals you may have crushed. some you may have made a dent in. some may have fell by the wayside. do you know that the failure rate for new year's resolutions is over 80 percent? but the thing is, a lot of those goals are unrealistic. sometimes we make too many resolutions at once. sometimes we just lose track or forget about them. so today, on new year's eve, eve, i encourage you to focus on 1-3 things you're hoping for in the new year. something you really want to change in the coming year! be specific. not just i want to lose weight, but instead, i will lose 1 lb a week until i reach my goal weight. not just i want to exercise or get in shape, but instead, i will work out 3 days a week. not just i want to eat healthier, but instead i will only eat out once weekly, or i will only have dessert twice a week. can you see the difference? you will be even more successful if you actually sit down and plan how you are going to accomplish these things! i.e. i will get up one hour earlier to get to the gym, i will pack my own lunch for work every day, i will stick to my grocery list and not buy the unhealthy snacks, etc. i've personally never been specific enough in my goals. but i do know this. it takes 21 days to make a new habit. so stick it out for the month of january and you just might have a lifestyle change instead of a resolution! i know what it's like to feel defeated. lost. alone. depressed. unhappy. after my divorce i lost a lot of weight like 35 lbs. i was feeling great. i was liking how i looked and how i felt. i went out and bought new clothes. but the thing is. i don't know how it happened. i hadn't really changed how i'd been living. and i obviously didn't lose the weight in the right way. the weight came back. well, 25 lbs at least. and so did the unhealthy emotions. it wasn't until i really stepped back and looked at my life that i learned that i needed to make some serious changes in my life. luckily my coworker introduced me to some amazing programs that helped me with my nutrition and i started working out on a regular basis. personal development is also a non-negotiable on a daily basis. i now not only am a healthier person both physically and mentally, but i also have a supportive community surrounding me and encouraging me every step of the way! are you ready to stop dieting and using workouts as a punishment? are you ready to embrace a lifestyle change that you can maintain? now enrolling people for my january accountability group! join me and together we'll navigate what a healthy lifestyle actually looks like and support each other along the way! did you move your body today? i did! and i am so grateful for that! i've been feeling under the weather the last two days. like literally took a three hour nap daily the last two days! today i felt better when i woke up. so i got up, practiced my personal development looks different every day!. and got my workout in followed by a healthy brunch. i got really tired around 1:30 and laid down but couldn't fall asleep. so i got back up and did some little projects around the house. i may not have accomplished a lot, but i did more today than i did the last two days! as i thought about my workout routine, i am so thankful that these programs are so flexible! if i had been paying for a class, i would have missed out. if i had to go to the gym, i probably wouldn't have gone again today... the program i am currently doing allows for 3 rest days during the week. so i haven't missed a single day of the program! glad i was able to listen to my body but glad to be back at it as well! how flexible is your workout routine? are you looking for more options? are you looking for support? accountability? gearing up for my new accountability group in january! link for more info is in my bio! merry christmas everyone! thinking about all of us healthcare professionals, service men and women and soldiers who are working this holiday! be safe and god bless! merry christmas everyone!! on today’s edition of what’s in this shake? cordyceps! it is a medicinal mushroom. known as a powerful immune booster. it also boosts exercise performance, has anti-aging properties, decreases blood sugar levels, helps with heart health and fights inflammation! they are also researching potential anti-tumor effects! cordyceps is difficult to harvest and carries a price tag of more than $9,000 per pound! pretty cool that this is included in my superfood blend! what are you fueling your body with today? where are my cheerleaders at you know who are. the one who's always standing on the sidelines cheering everyone else on? you are my people! i'm not trying to exclude anyone else, but let me take you behind my journey... for years i sat back and watched others achieve their goals. whether it be running a 5k or a marathon. losing the weight while living a busy, stressful life. i never thought that could be me. i mean i work full time and am on call many more hours. i've always been a couch potato, ate whatever i liked, never had to worry about my weight... and then i got older. the weight started to pile on but my habits didn't change. and in a way i felt completely naive! people all around me led active lives! they worked out, ate well and had been doing it for years! who was i to ask for help when so many people just knew what to do?! it was seriously one of the hardest decisions of my life to reach out to my coach and say i want to do what you are doing! the thing is i was afraid! afraid of what others would think and say. afraid of the hard work it would take! and probably most likely afraid of failing! and you know what? it hasn't been perfect. but i'm still here. every day. trying my best. you know why? i. am. worth. it. so as much as i enjoy watching you stand on the sidelines cheering everyone on, i'd much rather see you running the race along side us! because you are worth it too! so join me! let's finish this race together! 2020 here we come! who are these people?? a year ago, i knew one person that's in this picture. myself. i had never imagined being in a room full of so many like minded individuals. folks from all over the state and even some from around the country. all coming together with one purpose in mind. building a healthy life for not only themselves, but for others as well. i had never imagined working out with a super trainer in front of hundreds of people all of us with different fitness levels. but now i've done it multiple times! it all can seem quite intimidating, am i right? yeah, i still prefer working out by myself in the comfort of my own home, but if i've learned anything, it's good to step out of our comfort zones once in awhile. i have heard so many inspiring stories. i've received so much support, motivation and acceptance along the way. i can't imagine not having these people in my life! as we're heading into the holiday weeks ahead, i can't help but be reminded of how grateful i am that this community came into my life! if you're looking for an open-minded, safe, supportive environment to experience your own personal growth whatever that may look like to you let me know! would love to help you reach your goals in 2020! while the holiday season is merry for some we all know how stressful it can be as well! you may feel overcome by loneliness, become annoyed by meddling relatives or lose patience with your loved ones. you also may be worried about how you’ll be able to pay for gifts without maxing out your credit cards! am i right? so today i wanted to share some tips to help relieve some of this holiday stress we can feel! 1. take relaxation breaks! even if it's only 1 or 5 minutes. take some deep breaths. meditate. journal. whatever this looks like to you. practicing this in the morning will also help set you up for a great day! 2. move your body! research shows that physical activity not only boosts your fitness and energy levels but can also elevate your moods. in addition, exercise has been found to reduce anger, tension, fatigue and confusion. 3. eat the right foods! to be your most energetic, focused and happy self, it’s best to eat foods that grow on trees or on the ground vegetables and fruits and to choose healthy fats such as olive oil and flax seeds, lean protein such as fish and organic chicken and legumes, nuts and seeds. 4. be generous. one of the best ways to stay calm, content and cheerful this time of year is to act generously with your loved ones, co-workers and friends. this doesn’t have to mean you’re spending money! you can be generous with your compliments. you can generously offer to help a loved one complete a task. you can generously write a fun, short poem. when you are creative with your gifts people will appreciate your real, heartfelt sentiments. what are your tips for making it through the holidays? just a question for you... what does santa bring to your house? growing up my family always celebrated on christmas eve. family dinner. church candlelight service and then presents! santa came that night and filled our stockings. nothing special. toothbrushes. underwear. candy. maybe a few small gifts. it amazes me to see what santa brings kids now days... you’ve probably seen the posts but i’ll just reiterate it here on case you missed it... no one should have to explain to their child why his or her friend got an ipad or an xbox or whatever the next big thing is...while they only got a box of candy or some other small gift. so parents out there. take credit for the larger, more expensive christmas presents. let santa bring the less exciting gifts. there is not a child in the world that should feel bad about themselves because santa didn’t bring them what their friend got. finally! today i started and finished my christmas shopping! something i thought would take me 2 hours i mean it’s not hard to pick up gift cards took me over 4! and then the wrapping...still have a few more to go. i love wrapping gifts. it just takes awhile! are you a wrapper or bagger? with the grey, cold, snowy weather, i’ve definitely been dreaming of vacation! so here’s a throwback from my trip to nashville! counting down the days until i fly away again! what’s your favorite place you’ve traveled? what a fun day! mamma mia with family at the dinner theater today! it seems to be turning into a bit of a tradition to go to a show with family during the holidays. what are some of your family traditions? omg you guys! i have literally been dreading this day for the whole week! why? because i totally thought i was on-call for work! not a big deal to most people.....but if you're in healthcare i wouldn't even have to tell you why! just after midnight tonight we will experience our last full moon of the year....it also happens to be friday the 13th! superstitious? when it comes to working as a nurse....you bet! i sat here after work tonight just waiting for my colleagues to call me with updates! but no calls came... you can't imagine how relieved i was when i double checked the schedule and realized that another nurse was on call! phew! hope you all have a great night! i know i will be sleeping much better! and good luck to all you night shifters out there! what are you superstitious about? sunday’s are typically sunday funday. am i right? but someone i truly care about lost a loved one last night. so today we went somewhere they had good memories together to watch the vikings game. although they were somewhat estranged. i don’t pretend to know everything that happened in their lives. i deal with death on a daily basis as a hospice nurse. i am lucky enough to have a close enough family that i can’t understand estrangement. and even so, how you could refuse to let reconciliation happen? from my professional perspective it’s typically really important for both the dying and the estranged family member. closure it’s called. losing a loved one is never easy. especially during the holidays. so hold your loved ones close. take a minute to think about those you haven’t talked to in some time. is it truly worth it in the end? god has preached to love your neighbors as yourself. they are not perfect but neither are you. so forgive. forget. love. every moment you can. you never know when it will be the last chance you have. i've been doing this new barre program for almost a week now. i am telling you it is nothing like i thought it would be and it is kicking my butt! there is actually quite a bit of cardio which is not my fave. i am sore in muscles that i have never felt before. so much of it is core work which i definitely need! 3 lb weights are sometimes too much! but do i like it? yes!! it pushes me so far outside of my comfort zone and that's just what i need! still looking for others who want to rock this program or the program of your choice into the new year! ever wonder what's in these superfood shakes that i drink daily? they are so much more than just a protein shake! so, i thought i'd start sharing some of the ingredients and the benefits we get from them! ashwagandha is a traditional medical herb with multiple health benefits. it is classified as an adaptogen which means that they help the body resist stressors of all kinds, whether physical, chemical or biological. some of the identified benefits include: decreases blood sugar levels reduces cortisol reduces anxiety and stress fights depression boosts fertility and testosterone in men improves scalp circulation and strengthens hair stimulates the production of melanin so it may actually reverse graying of your hair! has both antibacterial and antimicrobial properties increases collagen production boosts brain function. that sounds like some pretty powerful stuff! want to know how to get your hands on some? i'm your gal! it's with a heavy heart that nurse friends who have worked for a company for 20 years are being let go as their position is being eliminated. it's with a heavy heart that programs, clinics and even hospitals are being closed. it's with a heavy heart that i saw nurses picketing today because they're working without a contract. is this the new age of healthcare? it is really a scary world we live in... i am sad. i am humbled. i am praying for you all... i am still thinking back over the last year and how much my life has changed. mind, body and soul! i was never someone who had to watch my weight growing up. and i would have never thought about exercising. and here i am today continuing to try new things and move my body in ways i never could have imagined! i was thinking my next program would be a weight lifting program. and i know i will do that program some day. however, a brand new program launched today. and i can’t resist! a dancer i am not. graceful, eh. but i am so excited for our new barre program! a friend of mine recently posted a sale from a local barre studio. the prices oh my gosh! do you know how much money you could save by choosing the barre program we offer? literally over $1000!!! mind blown! how could i resist this opportunity? let me know if you'd like to get your hands on the sample workout or would like more info! i have promo codes for the first 3 people who commit to rocking this program with me! watch my stories starting tomorrow for some inspiration! one year down and a lifetime to go! today i've spent a lot of time reflecting on the last 365 days. you see it was december 3rd, 2018 when i decided that my life needed to change. here i am one whole year later. i haven't met all my goals. but the point is i haven't given up. i continue to show up for myself every day. i decide to move my body. i decide to make healthy choices with my nutrition. and the best part of all is that i get to help people along the way! there are only 29 more days left in the year. how are you going to choose to use them? looking for help in reaching your goals both now and in the new year? i’m here for ya! happy thanksgiving! today i just wanted to share a few tips to survive the holiday! 1. eat before you go to dinner. even if it’s just a healthy snack. that way you won't arrive famished and overindulge! 2. drink 8 oz of water before you eat to keep you feeling full and well hydrated! 3. slow down! eating isn't a race. eat slowly. enjoy the company and conversation! 4. step away from the buffet! take a reasonable plateful and move away! whatever you do don't graze! 5. beware of liquid calories! sure it may be nice to have a glass of wine with dinner, but remember that alcohol packs in the calories and can increase appetite! 6. lastly roll with the punches! don't beat yourself up if you fall off the wagon. it's okay! dust yourself off and try again! where are my dancers at? today i tried out our newest programs sample workout! it is a blend of barre, pilates and also includes cardio intervals! i tell you what, it is no joke! i was expecting something easy and instead was sweating my off! i literally had to drop my 3 pound weights! it is low impact, high intensity and high energy! 30-40 minutes a day. 5 days a week. sound like something that interests you? drop me a note and i’ll send the sample workout your way! going to spend the day with this beautiful lady today! my mom has always been my biggest cheerleader. my no. 1 fan. my friend. even with all that white hair i’ve caused, she’s never given up on me. i am so grateful to have her in my life! who are you grateful for today? getyouryearlycheckup! are you one of those who never goes to the doctor? or only goes when they need something? do yourself a favor. get your routine checkups! do the screenings recommended for your age group! no it’s not fun. i get it! nobody wants to take off work and spend half a day sitting around waiting at the doctors office. but if doing just that would save your life? i bet you’d be there in a heartbeat! don’t wait until it’s an emergent situation. because once the damage is done, there may not be anything they can do for you. be proactive. take charge of your own health. can we just talk goals for a minute? like seriously, we all have them, right? but how big are your goals? do they scare you a little? maybe even make you want to throw up? i’ve always had goals that i’ve been working towards. but they were easily attainable. like write them on the list once their done just so i can check them off goals. as we finish up this year and head into the next, i’m setting some seriously scary goals for myself. and i’m going to share a few of them here with you to keep myself accountable! one. 1 star diamond coach. this is a significant rank advancement from where i am. mindset and team building two. wear a bikini on my trip in february. been wearing tankinis way to long! physical health and mindset three. travel more! for work and pleasure! time and financial freedom four. buy a new car or second vehicle! i could use something with better gas mileage for work! financial freedom five. be the best version of myself. every day! mindset and you know what? even though these goals scare me, i know that i will achieve them all! what are some goals you have that scare you? don’t have any? time to make some! no need to wait until the new year! do it now and think about how much further ahead you’ll be by jan 1! don’t know where to start? i’m here for you! let’s do it together! accountability is being on call for work has really messed up my morning routine lately! i could easily use that as an excuse not to get my exercise in. i prefer to work out in the morning. it just sets the tone for the whole day. but does that mean i cant workout at night? absolutely not you see, not only am i doing this for myself, but i have a whole group of women who count on me to show up every day! so tonight o didn’t complete one workout. i completed two! looking for accountability in your life? still have a few spots left in this months online boot camp! would love to have you join us! spent the evening with some of these lovely ladies tonight! love being able to be a part of an organization whose primary goal is to give back to the community! especially to those who have given of themselves in order for us to enjoy the freedoms that we do! it’s especially fun this time of year when we can be so generous to those in need! join your local organizations. get to know the members in your community. give back. you never know if one day you might be the one in need of assistance! just wanted to take this time to wish everyone a happy veterans day! thank you to all of you for you service! especially to those who gave their lives and paid the ultimate price. special shout out to my favorite veterans: grandfathers irv and ray father larry brother-in-law mark and currently in service: nephew jason land of the free. because of the brave! one thing i've always had a hard time with is making friends. i just don't put myself out there like others do. why? because i lost too many friends in my early years. like literally my 4 best friends all moved away from my hometown in a couple years time. two of them i've had little to no contact with for years. the other two i'd spend my summer time visiting and have stayed in contact with. i've found that it's not very easy to get close to someone when you go into a relationship expecting to lose them. and that’s why i have always had my walls up. and now, here i am...years later. becoming friends with total strangers on the internet who have a common goal in life. that’s pretty cool! are you looking to improve certain areas of your life but lack the support and accountability? are you looking for a group of ladies that you can instantly connect with on multiple levels? we’re here for you! next boot camp starts 1118! i only have one spot left!! me for more info! absolutely love this photo and the story of how it came to be!! you see the young lady in the middle is the daughter of a foreign exchange student that my dad’s family hosted years ago! through the power of social media, i learned that she was in minneapolis for the weekend! i was able to connect with her and my dad and aunt were able to meet up with her for the afternoon. this was 5 years ago. they hadn’t seen her or her family since they visited thailand in 2006! what an amazing opportunity for them all! still brings so much joy to me! what kind of wonderful things have you experienced when connecting with people through social media? oh my gosh! i had a really great time at the concert sunday night. in fact, maybe a little too much fun! 2 days!! 2 days it took me to recover! like when did i get so old?! finally started to feel like a human again this afternoon! felt good to get my sweat on and get some fresh air this afternoon. even if that just meant running errands! at what age did your body let you know you’re not 21 anymore?! definitely missing these girls, warmer weather, roof top bars and outdoor concerts! so tonight i’ll have to settle for a sweater and an indoor concert. ready for my weekend to start! is anyone else super excited to set their clocks back an hour tonight?? ok, sorry to those of you with littles at home! i hope they're not up too early tomorrow! i have been in such a funk lately. it's been really hard to get my butt out of bed enter snooze button here. my morning routine has been off. i'm still getting some of my list checked off, but not all of it like i like. hence, so many evening workouts lately! have you fallen off track with your morning routine too? personally, i am going to use this gift of extra sleep tonight as a stepping stone to getting back on track... last week was the anniversary of my dad's heart attack. i will never forget the feeling of my sister's call that morning, racing out the door and then meeting my home town ambulance, lights and sirens blaring, as we both exited from opposite directions onto the bridge that would carry us to the hospital. the tears were immediate. the anxiety was overwhelming. the thoughts racing through my head...devastating. i remember talking to the receptionist who had no record of my dad. i actually took a different route and beat the ambulance to the er! adrenaline? you bet! minutes later my dad rolled in with the ambulance crew and told me he was fine. it actually wasn't until later that evening when his symptoms worsened that he was stented. i am so grateful every day for the medical care that he received. so why bring this up today? lately i've seen so many ambulances and fire trucks and am just appalled by the number of people who don't pull over or yield the right of way to emergency vehicles. be respectful. what if it was your loved one they were trying to care for? thanks to a filter for dressing me up tonight! having so much fun seeing all the pictures of your little ghosts and goblins while i sit at home on call! only 7 kids at my house tonight...but probably didn’t help that i forgot to turn the outside lights on until after 7! so different than the days at the old house when i had 225 kids! hope you all had a safe and happy halloween!! i got my shot, did you? influenza season is upon us. in order to protect myself and the high risk population i serve, i got my flu shot today. remember, the flu shot protects against influenza which is a respiratory virus not the gi flu!! the cdc recommends annual influenza vaccinations for everyone age 6 months or older. vaccination is especially important for people at high risk of influenza complications, including: pregnant women, older adults, young children chronic medical conditions also can increase your risk of influenza complications. examples include: asthma, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, hivaids, kidney or liver disease. it takes up to two weeks to build immunity after a flu shot, but you can benefit from the vaccine even if you don't get it until after the flu season starts. it's usually best for people in the us to get their flu vaccine by the end of october. however, you can still protect yourself against late flu outbreaks if you get the vaccine in february or later. because flu viruses evolve so quickly, last year's vaccine may not protect you from this year's viruses. new flu vaccines are released every year to keep up with rapidly adapting flu viruses. the flu vaccine is your best defense against the flu, but there are additional steps you can take to help protect yourself from the flu and other viruses. these steps include: wash your hands often and thoroughly with soap and water. use an alcohol-based sanitizer on your hands if soap and water aren't available. avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth whenever possible. avoid crowds when the flu is most prevalent in your area. practice good health habits. get plenty of sleep, exercise regularly, drink plenty of fluids, eat a nutritious diet and manage your stress. you can also help prevent the spread of the flu by staying home if you do get sick. source: mayoclinic.com what's the first thing you think of when you think health and wellness? probably nutrition, exercise, mental health, sleep habits, etc...am i right? today’s psa: don't forget about your dental health as well! happy to say i had a great check up today! 0 cavities! show your teeth some love! sunday side by side! what’s the first thing you notice about these two pictures? the girl on the left was overweight, tired, lacking confidence, unsure of where she was going in life. the girl on the right is happier, healthier, exuding confidence, knows exactly what she wants in life and is taking massive action to get there! it’s amazing what a few short months can do! not only are there physical changes that have taken place, but i am in such a better place both mentally and emotionally as well. i think that’s pretty obvious to see! ready to make some changes in your own life? i’m here to help! spending the evening with these lovely folks tonight! going to see a minnesota icon tonight. mr. bob dylan! just yesterday i decided to pick up a 365 day devotional that i bought a few years back and devote a few minutes a day to reading this. wow! i could not believe how much i needed to hear what was written. it seems as though it was written just for me in the current valley i am experiencing. so let me share with you some of what i read just the last two days! 1. focus on you!! forget what others have to say about you. don't pay attention to those who do not share the same values as you. essentially, let go and let god. it is not your burden to take care of! the lord will take care of them in his time! so don't spend your time worrying. if you feel the need...just pray for them. 2. attend to what is pure!! when you choose to attend to what is pure, evil will have to flee. your time will not be consumed with anger and bitterness but with the peace that passes all understanding. whoa! that's powerful! 3. stop complaining!! essentially you are saying you don't trust god to take care of you. don't keep trying to open doors that are meant to remain closed. god will open the next door when the time is right. waiting is the difficult part. these are definitely 3 areas of my life that i work on on a daily basis. i am not perfect. it is not easy. but in the end, everything happens for a reason even if we don't always understand. so today i will just trust in what will be. you belong here! that was the theme of this years gathering in indiana that i attended. and it has truly struck a cord with me. there i sat as a baby coach of not even a year with some of the most legendary coaches in the business! yet i belonged there! in my day to day life, realizing that as a nurse of over 15 years...i belong there! on a recent trip with girlfriends from college that was way overdo...i belonged there! sitting in my home which i have worked so hard for...i belong here! so, where do you belong? if you're striving to find a caring community to share your experiences and grow mentally, physically, emotionally, professionally, and even finacially, you belong here! tomorrow night my team will be sharing a glimpse into coaching! if this is something that you're interested in, please let me know so that i can add you to the private group! after all...you belong here too! i am trying! do you ever feel like shouting this to the world? do you ever have days or even weeks where nothing seems to go the right way? like good grief! obviously the big guy upstairs has a better plan for me. in the meantime it can be so difficult to understand the why! maybe we are never meant to find out? so...i’ll keep praying. i’ll keep believing. i’ll keep doing my best. i’ll keep trying. i know there are better things in store for me and i am going to go find them!! honestly. my girlfriend and i were talking tonight about what “funks” we’ve been in since getting home from vacation last weekend... we honestly believe the universe is trying to tell us something! like hello! these girls were some of your best friends! though years and miles have passed between us...in a way we were better together! we need to treat ourselves to seeing each other more often! we can be the fun loving, carefree people we used to be! even if only for a little while! im telling you that spending the last week in nashville with college friends totally filled my cup. but now i feel like my cup is lacking. i like to practice gratitude and personal development daily. what else do you do to keep your cup full? think about it...and share with others! are you in some serious need of help with your morning routine? mornings are so essential to starting your day on the right foot! my mornings used to be so rushed. sleep in until the last possible minute, jump in the shower, run out the door...without even having breakfast! i felt that stress through my entire day... i knew i needed a change so i started to fit a few positive things into my morning routine one day at a time and now my mornings are relaxed and purposeful and i find myself going into my day with a better mindset. my team is hosting a free week long group teaching you a few healthy habits to embrace that will help you own your morning routine so you can start everyday off on the right foot! you in? comment below for the private link to the group! tonight i spent the evening with a group of women rolling socks! what? yes, socks. the american legion auxiliary in madison lake was collecting socks for the stand down event for veterans! tonight we rolled 1,034 pairs is socks! and we still have more that have been donated! this picture shows me with one of the packages donated. my age shows when i called them “tube socks”. so happy to have found this package that agrees with me! thank you to all who have donated to help our veterans! what's the worst thing about returning home after a vacation? work! ugh! you know how people say they need a vacation from vacation? yep, that's me today! i find it so hard to believe how much happens in a few short days. the emails pile up. the updates pile up. i don't even work in an office and most of the real work is completed by others while i'm gone. i could still literally spend a day just playing catch up. not only is the catch up hard, but it's also hard to come back to work knowing you're working the next six days in a row. to some that may not seem like that big of a deal, but i usually only work 4 days a week, so 6 in a row?! no worries. i pulled up my big girl panties and will get through. just can't wait until monday! what's the best thing about returning home after vacation? to me, there are so many things! first, when you open the door and smell your home! weird? maybe. but i find that nobody's homes smell the same. there's just something about smelling home that makes me happy! second, your own bed! i honestly think my friend's couch was more comfortable than my bed?! but there's also no better feeling than being cuddled up in your own blankets in your own environment! third, the shower! i don't care where i've been or where i've stayed, there's something about taking a shower at home that makes you feel so much cleaner?! last bit not least, the memories! i've already gone through all my souvenirs and pictures more than once! i can't thank these ladies enough for the memories we made over the past few days. hopefully it won't be so long until we can all be together again! 19 years is way to long! it may have been a little cooler and a little rainy today, but who cares! number 1. it’s still much better than the weather back home. number 2. i am having the time of my life. number 3. all of the laughing is keeping me warm! seriously. surround yourself with people who lift you up. smile often. laugh hard. i promise. you will not regret it! feeling extra lucky today i found the pot of gold! oh. and i’ve spent the last two days having a blast with girlfriends from my past in nashville! i’m not necessarily a country music fan. but this town definitely offers a little bit of something for everyone. feeling blessed. having some much needed fun in nashville! girls college reunion! tdoesntgetbetterthanthis said “see you later!” to some good friends this weekend! hope you all have a safe, happy and healthy winter! can’t wait to see you in the spring! i just realized that 5 months ago i was still wearing glasses! even though i wore my contacts for days on end i still find it hard to believe that i can see without them! not going to lie, i look back at the pictures of me in my glasses which i only wore because i had to pre-op and i kind of miss them! still, by far, the best decision i ever made! 5 months of unassisted vision! something i haven’t had since i was in 4th grade. still amazed! what a year of transformation i’ve had! loving life! so this happened today! something i never would have thought i could do in my past! i actually had pretty low expectations of myself. 1: don’t die or end up in a cast! 2: finish in at least an hour 3: just finish no biggie, right? happy to say that i crushed these little goals! it was wet. it was cold. there was mud. there was blood. but most of all there was fun! i always say it’s good to learn at least one new thing per day. today i learned a lot about myself! and i kind of like it! pulled my hair back so i couldn’t pull it out today!! much better day today. why? maybe because i’m off work for the next 8 days! definitely in need of this time off. looking forward to hanging out with ladies i haven’t seen in years! have any fun plans this weekend? thats all i have to say about today! tomorrow will be better, right? i am not ready although i love to cuddle up under a blanket, wear fleece and hoodies... i’m not ready for this cool weather! my house was 64 degrees when i got home from work today! furnace was turned on. if the sun would just shine... happy that i’ll be getting one more taste of summer next week when i’m traveling! just over 90 days left of the year!! have you met your goals? or have they fallen by the wayside in your busy life? are you waiting for the new year to create resolutions? how long do those resolutions typically last? i get it. life happens. we all get busy. we have responsibilities that pull us in so many directions. and now, here we are coming into a difficult time of the year. you or your kids may have just gone back to school. there is a holiday every month for the next 4 months where we tend to overeat or choose unhealthy options. hello halloween candy, pumpkin pie and christmas cookies! we will find ourselves surrounded by friends and family. for some of you that may be very enjoyable. but for some people it is very stressful. so my real question. why wait? why not now? what if you could have the tools to start a better life today? to prepare yourself for this stressful season of life? im currently looking for an awesome group of people who want to work with me to improve their mental and physical health. to show up being the best version of yourself everyday. they say it takes 21 days to build a habit and 90 days to build a lifestyle. now is the time my friends! instead of sliding into the new year in the same position as last year, let’s rock the new year with a healthy lifestyle! volunteering at the sal event today with justina! not many people showed up so my mom and i played to round out the bracket! was a good time! thanks guys! i typically love fall but it seems to be setting in so quickly this year! i seriously have no idea where the month of september went! tried to soak in the sunshine today although the breeze was a little chilly! i have a hard time finding things to do in the fall months. what are your favorite fall activities? the moment you’ve all been waiting for! here are my results from my 3 day cleanse! not going to lie. i didn’t see the results i was hoping for on the scale. on average they say people lose 5 lbs. me? zero point five! yes! 0.5 lbs ugh! i followed the program as written with only one exception which was my daily pre-workout drink and 3 extra, small asparagus spears. i did, however, lose 3 inches. and i think that shows in my side profile pictures. as i said earlier this week the most challenging part was definitely the mind games i played with myself. so glad that i had the accountability of others on my team to cheer me on. one of my girls lost 3 lbs and 4 inches! looking for accounts to help you reach your goals? i’m here for ya! emotional eater that’s me! i’ve been doing the refresh for 2 days now. i’ve been wanting to be active but not wanting to burn too many extra calories. i’ve found myself craving sweets and soda. i’ve found myself bored and wanting to eat. i’ve found myself getting hungry mid to late afternoon. the evenings have been the most difficult. but, so far i’ve stuck to the plan! it’s amazing how powerful our minds are!! this is definitely more of a willpower reset for me! it’s also been to have the accountability of some of my teammates! one day to go!! happiest of days to my momma today! may this trip around the sun be the best one yet! i’ll love you forever, i’ll like you for always as long as your living your baby i’ll be! hope you have a fabulous day! so glad i don’t have to dress up like this every day! mondays are my day off. but i had an important meeting today. it will take some time to hear how things turned out. but at the same time i’m so glad it’s over. time to move on. time to continue to make positive changes in my life. time for me. today i finished workout 50 of only 50 more to go! some ladies are way ahead of me. some are further behind. and you know what? it’s perfectly ok! there have been days that i’ve rested. days that i’ve doubled up. that’s what i love about this program. it is so flexible! i am committed to completing all of these workouts. why? because i deserve it. already feeling so accomplished and only better things to come! what are some recent accomplishments you’re proud of? warning this post may disgust you in a period of 5 days i learned that i was exposed to bed bugs, scabies and legionnaires while at work. like what i have been a nurse for over 15 years. i know all about standard precautions and treating all patients as if they’re potentially infectious. but my goodness a little prophylactic medication was recommended.... hopefully my immune system is ready to kick ass! in the meantime, wanna come hang out eat your veggies! today i ate my lunch in my car at the park note the air conditioning blowing on high! i didn’t have time to pack my lunch this morning, but instead of hitting the drive thru, i stopped at a store and got a healthy sandwich and vegetables. the healthy convenient store options now days! i looked over at someone parked a few spaces away. she was eating lunch as well. but she was eating a cookie...as i was eating a carrot! now don’t get me wrong. my eating habits aren’t perfect i’d actually thought about buying the edible cookie dough but in that moment i was just so happy that i’d made a healthy choice. what an awesome feeling to know that i’m fueling my body with healthy choices instead of just eating to eat or fill a craving! i’ve been introduced to a healthy eating style and a community of people who support me! could you use some help with your nutrition? are you an emotional eater? have a tough time staying away from the junk food or snacks? i’m here for ya! don’t miss out! a september to remember! that’s the name of my group this month! we officially start on saturday! there’s still time to join us! would love to have you! crazy hair and i just don’t care! definitely spent my day enjoying a very summer day! living in the midwest you never know how many more of these days you’ll get! although my football team didn’t win, i enjoyed the sun and finished an awesome book! there won’t be many more days like this. taking it all in! happy anniversary to this lovely couple today! today i spent the day at one of our other sites shadowing another nurse. it’s always interesting to see how others do their work. always learning. always growing. in all areas of life. it was a long day but so worth it! can’t wait to do it again some time! quick french braid i did tonight! biceps and braids!! this month’s free group! this is a team wide group full of a lot of awesome ladies! we kick off next week with awesome upper bodyarm workouts and different braid tutorials daily! how cool is that?!? held in a private fb group! message me for deets! so many things to be thankful for today. remembering all the men and women who lost their lives in the 911 attacks. blessed to have known some of the bravest soldiers this country has ever had. happy to be a part of a community that supports our community and veterans. currently accepting donations of new socks for a veterans event in october! message me if you’re interested in helping us out! less than one month from now i'll be on my way to nashville! i've never been there, have you? this is the college girlfriend reunion i’ve been so patiently waiting for!! we will be hitting up tootsie's the night we arrive! looking for advice on must see and do activities while i'm there! awhile ago i attempted a 3 day refresh, however, i did not complete it. so, i'm going to try it again...this time with support and all the ingredients i need to set myself up for success. i'm looking for a group of women who are interested in resetting their intestinal health and getting back to clean eating. this is a 3 day cleanse. others that i know have had crazy results in inches and weight lost. interested in joining us? send me a dm! when someone is going through a storm, your silent presence is more powerful than a million empty words. today i sat by a family as they watched their loved one take their last breaths. although very few words were spoken, i was just present. i hope that in some way it was of comfort to them. this is why i do what i do. it is an honor. a lot of kids headed back to school this week. it can be so difficult to get back into a good routine! i have learned over the last year that a good morning routine truly sets the tone for the rest of your day. even better than that, i've found an awesome group of products that have propelled me on my way. not only are the products amazing, but the people are pretty cool too! if you're looking at getting your health and nutrition back on track this fall before the onslaught of the holidays, i'll hook you up! i run monthly accountability groups and am always looking for others to join to help along their journeys! link to join is in the bio! so it’s getting real! one month from today i’ll be “competing” in my first ever tough mudder 5k. i am not a runner. never have been. and the thought of these muddy obstacles literally has me panicking! i am not out to beat anyone, finish in a certain time, etc. my goal is just to finish! that being said, i’m a planner. so what am i thinking about? what to wear? do you wear clothes and shoes that can be thrown away? do you get to shower off? bring a change of clothes or plastic for the car seats?! for real! any advice would be appreciated!! labor day has come and gone and it's officially starting to feel like fall! i truly love this time of year! i can open the windows and enjoy the fresh air. personally i sleep so much better when it's cool! warm enough to enjoy the day but easy to cuddle up with a blanket or enjoy a fire at night! and, to some people, fall is pumpkin everything?! today, pumpkin spice shakes launched! they are limited edition and i've already got my order in! are you a pumpkin fan? all our dreams can come true if we have the courage to pursue them. walt disney do you know that my team is going to disney this year? for those people who earn it.... whether i get there or not, i’m not sure i’d be able to go due to conflicting travel. but hello! disney! with a group of like minded people.?! that’s pretty fricken awesome!! ready to join a group of awesome men and women who always have your back? join us! we often take for granted the very things that most deserve our gratitude. cynthia ozick what are you grateful for today? overthinking... something a lot of us do. and what benefit do we receive from overthinking? anxiety? worry? stress? as zig ziglar says “overthinking is the art of creating problems that don’t exist.” the mind is a powerful thing. so fill your mind with positive thoughts. stop worrying. live in the present. take everything one day at a time. you've got this! throw back thursday! hopefully my mom and sister don’t kill me! does anyone else remember glamour shots? is that still a thing? why did anyone ever think this was a good idea? i mean it looks like we’re all just sitting around naked with feather boas?! not weird at all... oh well. good memories! hope y’all have a good laugh! so we're a few weeks in to this hands-free driving. typically this wouldn't be a big deal to me at all, but i spend so much of my time for work in the car. of course i didn't prepare for this and picked up a vent clip phone holder the day it went into law. this thing is so cheap! it doesn't always stay in place like literally falls under my feet when driving. and it blocks my air flow which i need on a warm day! and when i need to charge my phone? i've got wires running everywhere! my blue tooth is also very fickle. i try to turn off the blue tooth on my personal phone so that my work phone will pick up. and occasionally it will, but not always... so, looking for some advice here folks. what are the best hands-free options out there that won't break the budget? headset? other types of phone holders? i need help! sometimes we have to make choices we don't want to make. sometimes we have to do things that we don't want to do. why? because in the end we know we will be better for it. same goes for healthy habits. we don't always want to do it, but we know the outcome will be worth it! i went grocery shopping today.... everyone and their brother is posting pictures of their dogs today. but did you know today is also national toilet paper day?!?! so from someone that doesn’t have any fur babies, here’s a picture of me with my tp! because i’m weird like that! so here’s the controversial question...over or under? let’s talk snacks! which plate would you rather eat? which plate should you probably eat? choosing healthy snacks can be difficult. the unhealthy options are everywhere we turn! i am hosting a free week long group that is all about snacking! it can actually be really good for you! if you’re interested in joining us, link is in the comments! we start tomorrow! with the organizers of the end of summer lake party. good music. good food. good company. thanks ladies! we know how to send people out in style! our “formal” reception was yesterday. tonight was for the team! this social worker will be greatly missed by our team! best of luck on your retirement! per dictionary.com: starting around 1965, wednesday began being referred to as hump day. smack dab in the middle of the traditional work week, arriving at wednesday symbolizes that we've made it over the hump and the weekend is in sight. there’s nothing traditional about a nurse’s schedule! today was my “monday”. and i tell you what, i was definitely on the struggle bus. i actually reset not snoozed my alarm 3 times this morning. i have not been getting much sleep lately. this resulted in my getting up 1 12 hours later than normal. it made for a really rushed morning and a very seemingly disorganized day. here’s hoping for a good nights sleep and a better day tomorrow! new book alert! i’m probably the opposite of most people out there. i read in the summer! nothing like sitting outside in the sun enjoying a good book. i know a lot of people probably think there’s nothing better than snuggling up under a blanket reading a good book during the winter. i just can’t do it! i’d be asleep in minutes! either way, always looking for new ideas, books and authors. what are your favorites? have you ever stopped for a minute and thought about your future self? for real? i mean we think about what our future looks like and where we want to be in life, but how do your picture yourself in that life? i highly encourage you to really think about this! how can you gift your future self the best life possible? if you only focus externally, what will you have to give? that's why self care if so important! it may be kind of boring to exercise, eat right, save money, etc. but think about who you will be 10 years from now if you just simply do all those boring things! i'm sure your future self will thank you! if you’re interested in starting your own journey my tram has some amazing sales going on this week! message me for more details! i wore purple yesterday and realized i had to wear purple again today? why? pre-season football! as much as i may not be ready for summer to end, i football season! cool nights, appetizers, for real, i’m not a huge sports fan. but i don’t mind watching. especially when it include food and drinks! i am am also dedicated to my local teams. i’m a minnesotan through and through! skol vikings! ever take time to do a lot of simple tasks but fail to do the real work? ever make a list of things to do and fill it with menial tasks? ever add things to your list that you’ve already completed just so you can cross it off? crossing off a lot of little items may feel very rewarding. it may make you feel like you’ve accomplished a lot. but did you really accomplish much of anything if it wasn’t the most important thing on your list? i’m currently reading eat that’s frog by brian tracy. for real. do the hardest, most difficult thing first. the one that is going to make a difference in your life, your work, your relationships. the rest of the “stuff” will still be there. trust me. but if you do the hardest task first, the rest will be a breeze! at my coaching event in july rachel hollis made it a point the knowledge is not power. applied knowledge is power. i believe she got this from john maxwell. it doesn’t matter how much you know. it’s what you do with that information that will help you succeed in life. stop watching. stop waiting. just do the damn thing! that being said, my next challenge group starts monday! wouldn’t it be nice to go “back to school” with a new routine? message me if interested! although it's been over 15 years since i graduated from college and 20 since i first met these ladies, i so excited to be planning a trip with them! it has been 1, 3 and 5 years respectively since i've seen them! 3 of us will be flying in from 3 different states to see our 4th friend in a 4th state! it will be the first time in probably 18 years since we've all been together. so tonight, enjoy some pictures from that time frame! small family dinner tonight before my nephew heads off to college! hard to believe it's been 18 years since i first became an aunt. i was lucky enough to spend the first few months of his life caring for him. he wasn't an easy baby. sick, colicky. after taking care of all his needs, at times i would have to put him down on a blanket in the middle of the floor and just walk away while he cried. there was no way to comfort him at times. luckily i don't think i damaged him too much! he's grown into an amazing young man! michael, i know you will do great things. keep your head up and work hard. have faith in what will be. never forget where you came from. today i would have been married 15 years. but that’s not the case. instead, divorce. stigma? i don’t know. in my opinion. yes. but that’s my opinion. as someone whose parents are divorced. as someone who was married for almost 13 years and got divorced myself. i can’t help but feel “different”. don’t get me wrong. i understand it was a choice i made. was my marriage horrible? nope. from the outside did we look like we had it all? sure. has life since been easy? no way. in fact, i’ve been through more in the last few years than ever in my life. let’s just say the grass isn’t always greener. and you know what? i’ve blamed myself. for everything. the divorce. everything. and i’ve accepted it. for so long i believed i got exactly what i deserved. that this “new” life was my penance. it has taken my 3 years to figure out that i am worth it. that i deserve more than what my life has been for the last few years. that i don’t deserve to be “punished” for walking away from my marriage. do i sometimes wish i’d made different choices? yep. different decisions? sure. but i can’t change the past. all i can do is move on. learn from the experience. and grow in the process. happy anniversary! who could use some extra cash? there are probably very few people who would say, nah, i'm good. do you know that this coaching gig i do actually earns me extra income? imagine your name on this check!! that was never my goal with this. all i want to do is help others the same way these programs have helped me. but am i going to say no to the income it produces? no way! if helping others is allowing me to continually help myself pay for my products, i consider that a win-win! do you know that you can do the same? looking for motivated women to join me in helping others reach their goals! interested in learning more about this opportunity? shoot me a dm! this might be a little tmi for you gentlemen out there... but holy cramps! does anyone else experience increased menstrual cramps after working out? while a lot of what i've read states exercise helps with cramps, it seems to be common for some women to have increased cramps following strenuous exercise. it all has to do with the release of prostaglandins, diverted blood flow, etc. does anyone else experience this? do you pre-medicate? avoid the more strenuous exercises? looking for input for next month! losing weight is not easy. being healthy takes diligence and patience. it’s been a long road. and it’s only been months for me. that is not a long time to make a change in the grand scheme of things. at the same time, i hope to have a long time to continue this journey! there have been many frustrations along the way. unwanted weight gain, abnormal labs, emotions, etc. but i know that this is my future. this is my destiny. why? because i deserve it. i am worthy of it. i spend my days taking care of others. it’s about dang time i take care of myself. i have completed the first 2 weeks of my new at home workout program. it’s been just what i needed to restart my journey. i’m already down 4 lbs and feeling so much stronger and confident! i still have 3 promo codes for you to join me! what’s holding you back? what is your favorite thing to grill in the summer? i’m totally a steak girl! but tonight i was treated to a surf and turf dinner! grilled scallops wrapped in bacon along with the steaks i brought! sides of potatoes, brussels sprouts and carrots to round off the meal! so good! thanks momma! ever wonder what this drink is you see me having daily? it’s so much more than just a protein shake or meal replacement. it is full of premium protein, amino acids, antioxidants, super fruits, phytonutrients, super greens, adaptogenic herbs and botanicals, probiotics, prebiotics, fiber, digestive enzymes, vitamins and minerals! i love to drink mine daily for breakfast. it’s so easy to make and take with me on my way out the door. i like to add collagen, fruit, healthy fat and occasionally even veggies! it tastes so good and keeps me full and satisfied until lunch! what are your favorite go to smoothie recipes? who here is not a morning person? less than a year ago i would have had both hands in the air in agreement! i used to stay in bed until the last possible minute before rushing to get ready and get out the door. however, about 7 months ago i was introduced to a program that has changed my routine completely! i now get up an hour and a half earlier than i would have back then. why? because i have learned that it is truly the best part of my day! the house is quiet. i can concentrate and focus on what is important to me. i choose to move my body via my home workouts. i have the energy to give it my all! and, it just starts the day on a good note. working full time can be tiring. and who truly wants to work out or is able to take time for themselves once the stress of the day has begun? personally, i'm exhausted by the time i get home! it may be hard at fist, but just like everything else, getting up early becomes a habit. one i'd never give up again! what do your mornings look like? sometimes it’s difficult to continue to work towards a goal when you aren’t seeing results or change in the short term. but let me tell you this. consistency is key. nothing changes overnight. nothing changes without hard work and persistence. stay consistent and in time you will reap the benefits and rewards. ever feel like you’re driving 100 mph and getting no where fast? that’s me. every. day. always trying to stay ahead of the game. stay on top of my work. stay on top of life. and then bam! it hits you out of nowhere! and you’re stopped dead in your tracks. that is hypothyroidism and depression rolled into one for me. and it hit me really hard this weekend. like really hard! thankful to my friends and family for always supporting me no matter what i put them through. today is a new day. and tomorrow will be too. i have faith in what will be. had the honor of singing the national anthem at the local baseball game tonight! the hospice program i work for is amazing! oh, and we have a pretty awesome choir! glad the rain stayed away! was able to spend the day at the lake! music, friends, food. nothing better than a day at the lake...relaxing. one more day off filled with appointments! hope you all had a great weekend!! lazy day!! after a long week of work. quite a few days of not feeling well. it’s finally saturday! i was up early and able to get some work done. take a nap. have an awesome brunch. read my book in the sunshine! it was a lazy day. but a day of me. and i’m completely ok with that!! hope you’re all having a good weekend!! does anyone else find it harder to be “healthy” in the summer? i mean i know we all want to look good in our swimsuits and whatnot, but for me the struggle is real. my biggest summer obstacles... heat when it’s hot and humid i find it hard to be motivated to go sweat more. cooking i also find it really hard to turn my oven on to cook a decent meal. i also don’t always want a hot meal. but can’t live off of salads. beer need i say more? nothing like having a cold brew on a warm summer day! vacationsfestivalspicnics so much to do in the summer! hard to pass up the cheeses curds and funnel cakes, barbecue, etc. ice cream! yum. enough about that too! that’s just a few! what are your biggest obstacles during summer? treats in my group this month we are trying new recipes and sharing with the group! this is what i tried the other night! wasn’t the best but wasn’t the worst! personally i like all the ingredients individually but wasn’t a huge fan of them together. it was nice not to have to heat up the oven though! what are some of your favorite summer recipes that don’t heat up the whole house when you’re cooking? time.... something we all have a limited amount of. am i right? i see this first hand every day in the hospice work that i do. yes, time is limited. but i'm not just talking about the big, grand scheme of life. just day to day. we all have 24 hours. twenty-four hours a day. it is up to you to choose how you use that time. one of the biggest excuses out there when it comes to self care is i just don't have time. i get that there are so many things competing for just a small portion of your day. but how about putting you first? i seriously encourage you all to take even 10 or 15 minutes a day to yourself. fill your cup. read, journal, meditate, heck, through yourself a one-person dance party!! you'll be surprised by how much of a difference it makes! day 2100! i was so freaking tired this morning but got my workout done tonight! it’s going to be a really long week at work due to pto and nurses helping other departments! tuesday’s are my monday so that is hard as well! hope to get back at my morning routine tomorrow! interested in learning more about how this coaching business works? my team is hosting an online event tomorrow night for you to learn all the ins and outs! if you’re interested, let me know!! i’ll get you hooked up on our group! only one month late! was finally able to take my dad out for a late birthday and father’s day lunch! food was excellent! company was even better! love my days off during the week to catch up on life! tomorrow! i am committing to 100 workouts! so crazy! but, there are 10 different types of workouts to cycle through! no getting bored with this one! the moves are insane! but so fun! love the incorporation of the dj too! still time to join me! a whole different type of community today! today i was with my american legion auxiliary family participating in our town celebration! love my small town! love my community! love parades! off to have a little fun tonight! happy saturday!! working out with jericho mcmatthews again?! say what! say yes!!! tonight i attended our quarterly super weekend. i got to reunite with some of the girls i met in indy! and meet even more awesome young ladies! have i ever said how freaking on this group is?!? yes!!! we learned from some of the best. we laughed. we sweat our off! we had fun! if you do not have a group of people like this in your life that you would want to spend a friday night with, are you even living?! oh, and jericho’s new program launches on monday!! i’m in! are you? so technically today is results day! on monday i started our 3 day refresh. i thought this would be a great way to kick-start my weight loss again and get back to healthy eating habits. monday i started out strong. the fiber sweep wasn't nearly as awful as my mind had made it out to be! i hadn't fully prepared and didn't have any healthy fats to eat for lunch. so... by the end of the day i was starving! at least i thought i was, so i made some unhealthy choices. tuesday morning, i was still down 1.5 lbs! but, i woke up hungry! i thought i could get back on track and started out great again... and then things went south again. i had a really bad day and allowed my emotions to drive my food choices. it was at that point that i gave up on myself. but you know what? i'm ok with that. there are a few other demons i'm battling right now that probably should be taking up most of my focus and energy at this time. what i did learn from this is that i'm more of an emotional eater than i ever thought! i've also been fueling my body very poorly lately, which meant my body couldn't tolerate the calorie deficit. i also learned that i shouldn't do this on my days off too much snacking out of boredom! i will make sure that i'm able to set myself up for success and try again in the future! story of my life lately! so many miles driven but i’ve gotten nowhere but home. looking forward to planning my next adventure that doesn’t include driving!! ever have one of those days? today was just one of them. i had so many plans. so much to do. got very little done. and i cried my way home from the grocery store! why? no idea. a feeling? a song? like seriously. what the heck?! i had all kinds of things planned. for today. the week. and all of it went down the drain in a hot minute! depression sucks. just when you think you are figuring everything out. when things are going well. it rears its ugly head. you second guess everything in your life. every moment. every decision. regret tries make its way back into your life. you want nothing more than to be with a friend but nothing more than to be alone. it doesn’t make sense to most people. it often doesn’t make sense to me. but i am strong. i am learning. and after all, tomorrow is another day. all right folks! one week left until my next challenge group starts! i am ready to go all in with you! i will be starting our newest program called morning meltdown 100! our group will be a mixed group meaning you can choose whichever program you'd like. all we ask is that you show up for yourself daily within our group! not going to lie. i haven’t been as “on track” as i should be. so, starting tomorrow i’ll be doing our 3 day refresh and sharing my results with you this week! interested in learning more? ready to join me? link is in my profile or throw back...saturday... you know how everything always seems to be happening at once? yeah, that... this last weekend, there were so many things that i wanted to do. some i'm sure i will have a chance to do again in the future, however, one event only comes once in a lifetime. my twenty year class reunion! yes! i am getting that old! being that i still live in the area of my hometown, i do run into my classmates occasionally, but it just doesn't seem the same. i have yet to make it to a class reunion. weddings, work, something always seems to get in the way. it looks like you all had an amazing time! maybe i'll get there for my 25th?!?! here’s one if my senior pictures and a class picture! mhs class of ‘99!! do you make it to your high school reunions? this past weekend, i sat around a table with a couple girls one of whom i'd literally met the day before. we'd just heard rachel hollis speak that day about how we all go through our valleys. these valleys are the times in our life that, although difficult, build us into the stronger version of ourselves that allow us to overcome that next mountain. these ladies and i shared the valleys that we are each going through at this point in our life. it's not easy to talk about your struggles. but i tell you what...people are way more understanding than we think they will be. it's time to stop being ashamed, intimidated, scared, etc. of what is going on in your life! i encourage you all to see your valley for what it is...just that. learn from what you are going through and come out stronger on the other side! instead of wallowing in self pity or self doubt, pull yourself up and continue to move forward! and if you don't have supportive people in your circle? find a new circle! i'm sure glad i did! need help finding that new circle? send me a message...i've got you! you've made it this far. i believe in you. you've got this. carry on! i've worked as a hospice nurse for the last 8.5 years. i think i can speak for everyone in the hospice field when i say we always get asked how do you do it? it must be so hard! the truth is, it is so rewarding! yeah there are some cases that tug on your heart strings more than others. but that's in any field of nursing. we are all different people and we connect in different ways. never before have i worked with such an awesome group of people who truly support each other in our day to day work. and as a team there is a lot of focus on self care. i always think back to nursing school. it seems like so many people wanted to work in ob or pediatrics. more power to them. because to me, that would be so hard! and you know what that's not all unicorns and rainbows either. think of a stillborn baby, a baby born addicted to meth, a child abused to the point of near death and the need to be taken away from their parents... after losing my only grandparent at 93 and a nephew at 8 weeks, i knew where i was meant to be. i truly believe that the end of someone's life deserves just as much attention, love and especially compassion as the beginning of someone's life. i know that we make a difference not only in the short time our patients have left, but also leave a lasting imprint on their families. that’s what’s so special about nursing. so many different opportunities. that is why i do what i do... new product alert! we have a new boost! i was able to get my hands on some last week in indy. i began using it yesterday and they say you'll see results in as little as 30 days! so what is it? collagen!! it is made with bioactive collagen peptides to help increase skin elasticity, reduce the appearance of wrinkles, and support healthy nails. not sure how interested you gentleman may be, but ladies?? we are definitely not getting younger! can i get a heck yeah? it is odorless and tasteless so you can add it to anything you drink! personally i've added mine to my daily superfood shake and my post-workout supplement. don't even notice it! let me know if you're interested in getting your hands on some! today!! today is the day! our newest fitness program is available to you! this is early access and it won't be available to anyone else until october 1st! don't miss out on the chance to seriously change your life! 100 workouts set to music by a live dj?!?! heck yes! from cardio to core, it has is all! don't misread this. it is 100 workouts not necessarily 100 days. you can decide how quickly double up or slowly 5 a week you wish to complete them. all i ask is that you commit to completing all of them in your own time. the workouts are 20-30 minutes so there is no excuse to not get it done! sign up today to make sure you get your products in time to start on 72919! my next challenge group also starts that day can we say perfect timing? her i am just hanging out with jericho at summit! i've already committed to 100. join me! sometimes in life no matter how prepared you think you are, you get thrown a curve ball. last week in preparation of my upcoming road trip i took the car in for an oil change. i'd been having some issues with my brakes as well over the last 8 months as well, so i thought, hey let's check those out again too! yep, ended up with 2 new sets of brake pads. i was guaranteed that not only was the oil changed, but all the fluids were topped off. fast forward 3 days. imagine two girls. in the middle of illinois. on the side of the i-80. brake light blazing red. ugh! so frustrating. i was able to get a hold of the dealership. they gave me some tips. we limped our way to indianapolis and back by adding brake fluid at each of our stops...1,287 miles in total. now to see if we can finally figure out what the heck is really wrong with my brakes 4th times a charm? i seriously. can. not. even describe the feels i have. i have never, ever in my life experienced the community i have in the last three days. for real. i’m an introvert. i didn’t know what to expect coming into this. i was hesitant. i was scared. but. it has been the most uplifting, supportive, amazing group of people i’ve ever met! i thank god that all of you have come into my life. bless you all! and cant freaking wait to see you next year in new orleans!! the only difference will be i will have my own team here with me!! f’ing join me!! omg! seriously folks! talk about community and friendship! these ladies. i would have never have had a chance to meet these girls if it hadn’t been for this awesome coaching experience! so many great memories being made. so much great information swimming around in this head. one more day tomorrow! happy hour with the team!! then off to opening ceremony! so amazing to meet these ladies in real life. of course there’s some i’ve known for a long time, or at least more than once in the past. but right now i am literally surrounded by ladies i met in person for the first time just a few hours ago. and i feel at home. made it half way this evening! relaxing at the hotel this evening. two more states tomorrow where we will meet up with the rest of the team! one sleep, one workout, one long day of waiting! in 24 hours i will be halfway to indy! safe travels to everyone! can’t wait to meet you all in person! having a good night with a fun friend! the weekend festivities continue! had a great time golfing today! good weather. cold drinks. awesome meal. great company! then the storms came. now i’m just hoping my sump pump keeps up. it is literally running every 5 to 7 minutes. yes. i timed it. hope you’re all safe and dry tonight! happy 4th of july! had a pretty chill day! got a little too much ended the day at the lake. nothing too exciting! hope you all had a safe and happy holiday! land of the free, because of the brave. ‘merica that’s one happy lady right there! happy but tired! you know when you have a few days off and you’re preparing for a trip how busy you are? yep. i’m there. lists are made. appointments are set. getting the car tuned up. laundry. packing. the list goes on... i’ve done all i can for today so i’m calling it a night! wishing you all a safe and happy holiday tomorrow!! whoop whoop! less than 24 hours of work left before i’m officially on vacation! nursing can be so rewarding but also completely draining at times. it is so important to remember to take time for self care! so what am i doing?! not a lot of anything. relaxing, having fun. oh and an itty bitty road trip next week! more to come... one more sleep and one more hopefully not too long of a day at work tomorrow! how are you all spending your vacations this summer? today something amazing happened! all coaches in my organization had the option to get a sneak peak at our new fitness program! at 5:30 am i was totally on my computer and ordering my accessories. if you can't tell i am so freaking excited for this! i have been in a slump with my current program. 60 minute workouts, 6 days a week. one of which i just despise and happens to occur every saturday! this is totally the right timing for me. i've never tried a new program as it was launched. but now is the time! these workouts are so quick 20-30 minutes and it totally flies by! don't think you can get a good workout in in only 20-30 minutes? i dare you to give it a try. you will be dripping with sweat by the end! i commit to 100! are you with me? the pic on the left is when i started my journey. the pic on the right, how far i’ve come. not only am i much better at taking selfies i’m so much healthier, stronger, and happier. i am so glad that i took a leap of faith and joined this awesome community. we have an amazing opportunity tomorrow! the newest fitness program is launching! 100 all new workouts mixed with a live dj?! say what? the launch is exclusive to coaches at this time. want in? i have a way! if you’ve been watching my posts or stories and been thinking of joining me, i’m telling you now is the time!! shoot me a message if you're interested in learning more! what a fun night! thank you to everyone who came and supported the american legion sal and auxiliary. good music. good music. good fellowship. awesome fireworks! thank you for joining us! it was fun! do you know that thyroid issues affect approximately 12 of the population? so it's no surprise that i am meeting people with thyroid disorders along my journey. the lamest excuse i get when i speak about nutrition is i can't eat vegetables. yes you can there are a ton of recommendations about food to avoid when you have thyroid problems: caffeine, alcohol, excess fiber from beans and legumes, processed foods, sugar, fatty foods and all things fried, gluten....and lastly cruciferous vegetables. that is a ton of restrictions and i can guarantee you, you are not avoiding all of those recommendations. you guys, i have hypothyroidism...and i eat vegetables! there's only a handful of cruciferous vegetables....and i eat them too! do you know that cooking them properly will reduce the harm of them? try it, you might actually like it! do you ever just get a song stuck in your head? it happens all the time in my world! the last two days it's been father and son by cat stevens. google it.... there's just something about the composition that really clicks with me. according to wikipedia....the song frames a heartbreaking exchange between a father not understanding a son's desire to break away and shape a new life, and the son who cannot really explain himself but knows that it is time for him to seek his own destiny. i think all of us have been in a place before where others don’t understand our why, or maybe our timing. it is your destiny. don't let anyone hold you back. go out there and conquer the world! i believe in you! and someone please send me a new song to listen too! you know what? i've never considered myself a morning person! until...the last few months... i am finding that i'm getting up earlier and earlier. why? because i'm worth it! it is the quietest time in my day. i am able to sit and read some personal development. have my pre-workout drink. check in on my challengers. and most importantly push play on my workout! if you've never read the miracle morning by hal elrod i would highly recommend it! he totally encourages you to incorporate so many of the things that we also promote in our challenge groups! remember that you are worth it too! as hard as it may be to get up when that alarm goes off, just think about all the time you'll have for yourself! before the kids get up, before the husband leaves for work, before you have to get up and truly get going for the day, before life gets too busy to think of yourself! it is so peaceful! so i challenge you all to get up an hour, 30 minutes or at least 15 minutes earlier than usual and see how much you enjoy your you time! let me know how this works for you! if you need me i’ll be in my office! getting caught up on some health and wellness work tonight and also on call for work. win-win! don’t forget to head over to our facebook group for our “night of deals”!! would hate for you to miss out on an awesome opportunity to join the team! not able to join us tonight but interested in learning more? link to join is in my bio! can’t wait!! one week left! we’re talking huge savings but they only last through the end of the month! our team is also hosting an event tomorrow with crazy good deals! interested in learning more and saving money in the process? drop me a and i’ll get you hooked up! decided to venture out a bit today. laundry done. hairs cut. groceries bought. then headed to the lake! was able to enjoy a little bit of music before getting rained out! no matter what has been going on, i’ve gotten my workouts in all week! i took my rest day on a different day than normal, but got them all done! next month an amazing new program launches! it’s a 100 day program!?! what? yes! i never personally thought i’d have it in me. but in the last 6 months i have missed 2 days of working out. yes 2!! and i’ve made both of them up! we will be hosting an awesome event this week which will also give you a discount on the new program! sample workout available now! let me know if you’re interested! carry on! got some great sleep last night and and a nap! lazy day. thought i was starting to feel better until i ate... i don’t know what in the world is going on in my gut. but i wish it would move on! have you ever been through food sensitivity testing? starting to think about it...for real! going to keep a low profile all weekend. except to pick up some healthy foods! hope you’re all having a good weekend! i believe in you! you’ve got this! tried to bring a little sunshine to the day by wearing something bright! it has been quite a week! i’ve been dealing with a food intolerance, it’s that time of the month, long night on call, little sleep...the list goes on. i still made my workouts a priority and did as best as i could with my nutrition given the circumstances. now it’s friday night and i am dead tired. heading to bed soon...i know it’s only 8:30. but i’m going to listen to my body for once! hope you all had a great week and have an even better weekend!! make it happen, today! happy friday!! happiest of birthdays to this guy right here! 73 years young today! in his words “it’s just another day when you’re as experienced as me”. love you and blessed to call you dad! hope you had a wonderful day! have a beer for me! celebrating a very special guy today! 73 years young! if you see home today, rub it in! love you dad! late day at work but got to enjoy a little time on the deck to unwind! nothing i love more than reading a good book on the deck! what are some of your favorites? currently reading girl, stop apologizing and something like happy. a little personal development and a little fun! make it a great day! let’s all do some amazing things! delicious and nutritious! focusing on nutrition this week! what are your favorite go to meals? let’s make healthy choices today! after working the last 6 days plus being on call, i’m letting loose tonight! it’s all about balance, right? i got my shake in. i got my workout in. now i’m ready to have a good time! i didn’t want to do much of anything today. not going to lie. but it’s the first official day of my june challenge group and i wasn’t going to let those ladies or myself down! so i put in the sweat equity this morning and am having a little fun this evening. the amazing thing is that i can get right back on track again tomorrow! no regrets. follow you heart. push yourself. make your dreams a reality. happy father’s day to my favorite dad! so thankful to have you in my life! through all of the hard times you’ve always been there for me! even though we don’t always see eye to eye, i wouldn’t have it any other way! sorry i had to make the big bucks today and couldn’t be with you! i appreciate all the adventures we’ve shared! love you forever and always! enough said! so freaking excited! today i completed the first phase of the 80 workout program i am currently doing. it is not easy. the workouts are longer than any program i have done before. but i know that i am getting stronger every day! going to treat myself to some heavier weights for phase 2! it’s amazing how far i’ve come and what little things i get excited about! my group officially starts tomorrow! join me! what are you waiting for? go out there and do it! wearing my red, white and blue for flag day! yep, i’m one of those people! no cares! workout superfood shake healthy eats showing up fully for myself and my patients today let go and let god. hope you all had a great day! back on the bandwagon today! a promise to myself. you know what? for the most part i don't care what people think about me. i am living my life, making my choices and living with them. yes, sometimes i do question what i'm doing or the decisions i've made. i think that's natural. but when someone calls out your character. believes you are making things up. diminishes the importance of your story. that is hurtful. even though this person doesn't even know me personally, it's been dragging me down all day. the first picture is me on the verge of tears. the second of me putting on my happy face for all of you. so freaking frustrating. why should i let someone i don't even know affect me so much? i have definitely been in a funk all day. i have allowed this negative person to get to me enough to make poor food choices, not be fully present for others and drag my mood around in the mud all day. what i do know is that tomorrow is a new day. bye felicia yep i said it! happy thursday! evening out with these beautiful ladies! sorry to those we missed that left before the picture! it may look like we are just having a good time, but we are really supporting a good cause! love my community and the organizations i belong to! what are you thankful for today? oh my gosh! forget the mistake, remember the lesson. had no idea when i posted that today that i would experience it today! i was very lazy this morning. i still got up at 5:30 like usual, but i just had no motivation. so i did a little work, but chose to forgo my workout. huge mistake! i did get my workout in this evening. but, i know i wasn’t pushing hard. it made me feel physically ill. and now i’m exhausted. i also felt sluggish and just “off” all day. it doesn’t matter how big or how little our “mistakes” are. there is always something we can learn! as for me, i know i’ll be pushing play tomorrow morning! who’s ready to join me? prep starts tomorrow! group officially starts on monday! don’t let anything get you down or hold you back. everything in life is a lesson. learn from it and move on! one of my favorite authors wrote: but ask a thirty-seven-year-old woman to take up crossfit for the first time, and she'll immediately start to imagine all the reasons she'll suck at it, and before she know it, she's talked herself out of even trying a single time. rachel hollis this really spoke to me, as i just happened to be 37 when i started my own fitness journey. granted i'm not doing crossfit, but i am doing cross training. and i have been doing it consistently now for over 6 months. it is so easy to let our minds come up with so many reasons why we've already failed at something we have never even tried. let me tell you this...you are not too old, you are not too weak, you are not too busy, you are not too insert anything else your mind says here. i believe in you. and i know you've got this! you can do whatever you set your mind to! don't believe me? join me! applications for my june boot amp end this week! keep going! make it a great day! to me there is nothing more centering than doing a little yoga on a sunday. it totally clears my mind and sets me up for the week ahead. no matter is your religious or not. no matter which religion you choose to follow. i just enjoy the peaceful movements and stretching. so grateful that these at home workouts offer so many options! can’t wait to get our next group started! its not too late to save $20! join me! early to bed, early to rise. followed by a long nap! felt so good to get a little extra sleep this morning! have a great day! you guys. it isn’t easy. the biggest struggle i have is comparing myself to others. but you know what? i’ve never been a model. i’ve never been a size 0. i’ve always been what i refer to as “thick”. nobody even believes me when i tell them what i weigh. at least i’m well proportioned! but you know what! it’s o.k.! why? because when i look at side by sides like this, i know that i am making progress. will i ever be a size 0? absolutely not. that wouldn’t be healthy for me. so here i am. sharing my own journey. no shame. wouldn’t you like to join me on your own journey? what. an you be grateful for today? ok ladies and gents! it’s time! now taking applications for my june challenge group! prep week starts 612 so it’s time to get signed up! bonus: ask me how to save $20 when you sign up today! let’s do the damn thing! link to join in my bio or drop me a what are you going to do today? just a view on my break yesterday! fun fact about urine output and water consumption today... yep! i’m a nurse! the average urine output for adults is about 1.5 liters 6.3 cups a day. you lose close to an additional liter about 4 cups of water a day through breathing, sweating and bowel movements. food usually accounts for 20 percent of your total fluid intake, so if you consume 2 liters of water or other beverages a day a little more than 8 cups along with your normal diet, you will typically replace your lost fluids. courtesy of rutgers don’t you feel smarter now?! some days! that’s all i have to say about that! hope you were all able to enjoy some sunshine! moving forward is still progress! happy hump day! this was the second wave of weather this evening! hopefully all are safe and sound! lots of wind. a bit of thunder, lightening and rain. at least the humidity dropped! let’s grow together! happy tuesday! it was a lovely day off! spent most of the day outside! shopping for and planting flowers! reading. playing bocce. and just enjoying the day. minus a few gnats. i have been getting eaten alive despite bug spray, vanilla, dryer sheets, etc. what is your go to keep the pesky gnats away? they are horrible this year! are you ready to change? we’ve got big sales going on this month! interested? just ask! thank you all for the wonderful wishes today! it was a busy weekend of get togethers! hope you all had a great weekend too! i seriously can not believe this is even happening! my nephew...graduating from high school! the little guy i babysat for the first few months of his life. i know that there are many people my age that have had kids graduate already, but holy cow does it make you feel old or something! i guess maybe if i had kids, it would be different. knowing me, i'd probably be ready to kick them out of the nest by now. but wow. time sure does fly. wishing my nephew and all the graduates this year the best of luck in the future. god knows some of you need it more than others! go out and conquer the world. be happy. live life to the fullest. and never forget where you came from it is part of what has made you who you are. congratulations!! congratulations to all those who are graduating today! i’ll be spending the morning with my favorite 2019 grad! just my dad and i goofing off during tonight’s long and warm graduation ceremony! it’s been a long day! hope you all have a great weekend! what if? who loves what they do? who wishes they had more? who wishes they could do more? there are so many opportunities at your fingertips! don’t let them go to waste! interested in learning more about the opportunity i have to offer? all while improving your own health and wellness? it’s a win-win! hit me up! it’s all about the action! look out world! had a little talk with a fellow coach the other day. it centered around effort. needless to say, we have been lacking effort in our businesses. sure, i show up for myself daily in my workouts and nutrition and for my team, but i haven't been showing up for you! there is still time this month to get started! let me know if you're interested so you can start your own journey! i promise you it will be worth it! your effort will determine your outcome. even if you don't believe in yourself, i believe in you! but first we must get started! wednesdays can be hard! hope you have a great day! have you been ever been told you weren't good enough, you were never going to make anything of yourself, you never complete anything? the list could go on and on. did you let that set you back or get you down? or did you push through with more passion than ever? i’ve chosen the latter. although words can be very hurtful, if is how you choose to deal with them that makes you weak or strong. be strong my friends! push through for you. find your passion! go for it! make it a great day! humility. that is my word of the day. i'm sure a lot of you were disappointed with the weather today, being that it's a holiday and all. but i personally found it quite humbling. not only have i been working all weekend and not enjoying the holiday, but i'm sure a lot of you had outdoor plans that were canceled or changed due to the weather. i hope you were able to take a step back and take a moment to really reflect on what this holiday means. yes, the barbecues and family get togethers are fun. but what about all of those who sacrificed their own lives for our freedom? did you take a moment to remember them? thank you for your service! i will wear my poppy proudly in remembrance. happy memorial day! nope! i didn’t forget! today is a rest and recover day. essentially just stretching. i chose not to make it a priority this morning and then had a super busy day at work. so after getting home at 8:45pm, and eating a not so healthy supper, i pushed play. i learned this foam roller i have is pretty worthless. so i will be investing in a new one. i also learned the importance of making my workouts a priority no matter what they are. no more 10 pm, last minute exercising. hope you’re all having a wonderful holiday weekend! sunday thoughts! was able to enjoy a little time at the lake after work today! great supper with mom, dawn and les! thanks for the great food and company! what’s everyone up to this weekend? enjoy your day! i’ll be at work! all you can do every day is show up and be better than who you were yesterday. quit comparing yourself to everyone around you. we are all on our own journeys! as my good friend rachel hollis says what other people think about you is none of your business! no one else has any idea what your story looks like. so don’t allow their judgements to hinder your own growth! stay strong and keep moving forward! you’ve got this!! compare yourself only to the past you! what other people are doing or thinking is none of your business! you’ve got this!! well i’m 5050! still pushing to meet my water goal daily! the last month i hit my goal almost half the time! still room for improvement! what goals are you working on in your health and wellness? would love to help you succeed! link to learn more is in my bio! happy thirsty thursday! huge changes have been taking place in my life. after years of hoping, and wishing, and taking chances, it is definitely time for change! i figured it was time to post another transformation picture! this is almost 6 months in the making! although not every day is easy, i continue to make progress. and that's what it's all about! interested in knowing more about what i'm doing? what our favorite products and programs are? my team is hosting an awesome event tonight which will provide not only information but great deals! if you make a purchase, you will automatically receive a gift card! there will also be a grand prize drawing for $100 gift card! can’t make it live? the deals will last for 24 hours! you’re not going to want to miss it! link to join is in the comments! make the changes you need to succeed! someone wise once said, fail to plan and plan to fail. how true is that? the other day, needing a quick lunch option, i stopped at the local tj's. i was really going to order a taco salad with chicken, but somehow super potato oles with beef came out of my mouth! weird how that happens! lunches can be so hard for work. i never know if i'll have access to a fridge, microwave, etc. so that really limits the options. my goal is to start planning a little more! we all make poor decisions at times, however, if you plan, you're more likely to make better decisions. how do you plan your meals for work? any tips of tricks? make wise choices nutritionally today! having planned this over two weeks ago, today i spent the day with a good friend at a local park. little did i know how much i would need this today. pictured are some of the koi we fed. how fitting that koi often stand for luck, prosperity and good fortune. exactly what i need in life at this time. keep going. everything you need will come to you in the right moment. the journey continues with a few plot twists! hope you all had a great day! make it a great monday! seriously...the hardest things in life take the most faith. it has been an emotional rollercoaster of a weekend. and i can tell you i haven’t been at my best today. after spending most of the day in bed feeling sorry for myself, i got up, rocked out my workout, ate a nutritious meal and got some household chores done. nobody said that living your best life would be easy. but i know it will be so worth it in the end! prayers to all of you going through hard times. i’m so happy i have the support of my virtual community to keep me accountable and help me through the tough times! tomorrow will be a better day! happy sunday! have faith! our group selling the raffle tickets during the barbecue event today! thanks for all who came out to support the ala and sal! i will be volunteering this afternoon! hopefully the weather somewhat cooperates! have a great saturday! have you ever not done something because you were afraid? its probably pretty safe to say we all have. what was your reason why? did you learn anything from that opportunity? most likely you did! was it worth letting fear hold you back? or is it maybe something that you regretted not doing? we spend so much time just waiting for the right time. guess what? there probably will never be a right and i can almost guarantee there will never be a perfect time. so why let fear hold you back? what are you really afraid of? you're seriously one decision away from a totally different life! let’s do the damn thing! join me?! happy friday y’all! have a great day! i’m happy to say that my water intake is trending back up! i’m still treating myself to some other drinks, but back to water first! did you know that a lot of times when you feel hungry you’re actually just thirsty? did you know that drinking a glass of water before you eat will actually decrease the amount of food you eat as your stomach will sense fullness sooner? did you know that drinking cold water actually speeds up your metabolism? did you know that drinking water actually helps you burn more fat? just a few of the great benefits of drinking water! hydrate! ok ladies and gentleman! last call to get in on this months group “spring into summer there’s no time like the present to start something new! don’t let another month go by! let me know if you want to join us! why are you waiting? happy wednesday! a lot of people don’t understand hospice care. a lot of people don’t understand why or how i can do what i do. my whys? my 93 year old grandmother who lived a long and happy life. my 8 week old nephew who was taken too soon. death is a part of life. we only get to do it once. so why not make it the best it can possibly be? that’s what i get to do day in and day out. it is truly an honor to be welcomed into someone’s life to walk them home. you see hospice isn’t just about dying. it is about living. making sure that we allow people to live as comfortably as possible for whatever time they may have. back to work today! have a great one! how many times have you thought about doing or trying something new or different? what stopped you? taking that first step can be beyond scary. all the unknowns, the what ifs. but what if it's worth it? are you going to look back years from now with regret? i still have spots open for my may accountability group! when you're ready to get this party started, let me know! take that step! happy monday! happy mother’s day to the most amazing woman in the world! i wouldn’t have it any other way! hope all you moms have a great day doing whatever it is that makes your heart happy! as for me, i’ll be spending the day with my mom! i have seriously found so much to be thankful for this week! earlier this week i was given the gift of unassisted sight. something i haven't had in 28 years if my calculations are correct! it is like every day is a whole new experience for me! on wednesday i drove without corrective lenses for the first time in my life! wait, what? i also noticed how dirty the shower was getting... you take the bad with the good! but i could freaking see it! i have seriously been given such a huge gift! my only question is why did i wait so long? ugh! hindsight is 2020, right? this whole process has seriously been eye opening more puns. i hope i can continue this new enthusiasm and gratefulness for all the little things in life for a very long time! what do you have to be thankful for this week? hope you all have a great weekend! what are you thankful for? not only do we focus on healthy eating and fitness in my monthly groups, but also personal development! of course fueling your body with the right foods and getting regular exercise are going to make you feel better physically. but what about mentally? we really recommend reading or listening to books or podcasts which help improve our mindset. i am currently reading you are a badass. it is so good! at the end of almost every chapter, jen sincero reminds you to love yourself. that's all personal development is....learning to love yourself through the process. what are your favorite personal development books? would love to hear! make it a great day! happy friday! definitely did not do well with my water this week! i’m just going to go ahead and blame the fact that i had surgery. but that would be an un-truth. soda again! ugh! i need to knock it off! i will get my water in daily for the next week! i pledge this to myself! how do you make sure you get meet your water goal daily? it’s thirsty thursday! drink up! do you know that our newest nutrition program also includes kid friendly nutrition and recipes? hold it right there! it is not a weight loss program for kids! it is a way to fuel their growing minds and bodies with the right foods based on their age, gender and level of activity. you also get access to a bunch of kid approved and healthy recipes! of course they don't need to know that.... how cool is that! include them in the process. have them pick out a new fruit or veggie to try on the weekly shopping trip. have them help with simple tasks in the kitchen. most of all model the behavior. kids always seem to want to eat what is on mom or dad's plate, not their own! so make sure you're practicing what you preach! interested in helping your whole family get healthy? shoot me a make healthy decisions my friends! what are your tips for saving money while eating healthy? that’s me! under the laser! got my lasik done today! i know it’s going to be so worth it in the end, but right now it kind of sucks! i can see for the first time in about 28 years without the assistance of contacts or glasses. but these eyes won’t stop watering and i feel like there’s gravel under the lids! i’m thankful for the technology that has given me back my vision. my true life vision continues to evolve. i’m so grateful for all the changes that are taking place in my life. i am in such a better place mentally, physically and emotionally. i know there are great things in store for me! my future’s so bright i’ve got to wear shades quite literally right now!. what is your vision for your life? can i help you reach any of those goals? you know how to find me! today i will literally regain my sight. but it is the vision in life that is so important! what is your vision? not going to lie, it was hard to be a badass today! my head was pounding most of the day so i took a nice long nap! still got my workouts in, completed our group plank challenge and got to the grocery store. just a little later than i’d hoped! set myself up to have a great week! hope you all had a great monday and set yourselves up for success! a great reminder for all of us and happy nurse’s week to my colleagues! continue to be badass every day! today i’m thankful for all of the obstacles i’ve overcome in life. it is what you have been through that shapes you not just into the person you are but also the person you’re becoming! i’m am lucky to have found such a supportive community through my wellness journey! ready to move mountains? enrollment in my may group is starting! hit me up! have a great day! busy day at work today! ready to call it a night! hope everyone is having a great weekend! have a great saturday! you guys! today was a totally lazy day! but you know what? it felt so good! i still got my workout in. had my super foods. minded my nutrition and got most of my steps in. but other than that i didn’t do much! sometimes you just have to slow down and smell the roses! listen to your body. we can’t be “on” all of the time. give yourself a break. back to work tomorrow! make good choices today! happy friday!! why is there a picture of me squatting in a public bathroom? it’s part of our group challenge today! drink your effing water. sounds simple, right? for me? not lately. i've gotten into the bad habit of drinking ginormous glasses of fountain pop again! this week i'm working on reaching my water goals! so this challenge couldn’t have come at a better time! a gallon of water today! that’s a lot of trips to the bathroom! will post my tracker next week! today in our group we are challenging everyone to drink at least a gallon of water! i better start drinking! today was a really long day at work! but you know what? it was amazing too! i am lucky enough to work with a really great group of people and we are truly a team! i spent my morning providing education to caregivers from a local home health agency. after multiple changes to my schedule, this afternoon, i was able to settle someone back home, which is where they wanted to be. the hours may be long. the work not always easy. but to know you've made a difference in someone's life is invaluable. i am very lucky to have not only a fulfilling job to go to every day, but also a very fulfilling side hustle to come home to every day. do you feel fulfilled in the work that you do day in and day out? if not, lets chat! i have a very special place for you on my team! make a difference today! stuffed peppers and corn for supper! it’s not glamorous. i could definitely use some help with plating and presentation. but it’s real life. how are you fueling your body today? think about what you’re eating. are you living to eat or eating to live? fueling your body with the right foods will change your life! stop indulging and start truly eating! this! this was before i started my workout today! i pumped myself up because i knew it was a workout i didn’t particularly care for. but i did it anyway! why? because i’ve learned how important it is! getting my workout done in the morning sets the tone for the whole day. i feel healthier, happier and stronger throughout the day. and i know if i wait until the afternoon or evening it will be that much harder for me to push play. it may have taken about 38 years for me to figure it out, but i’ve never felt so physically, emotionally and mentally well before. it was a tough one today! but i didn’t die. i may have felt like i was going to at some point but i didn’t! you can do anything you set your mind to. if it’s important you’ll find a way. if not you’ll find an excuse. what’s important in your life? never miss a monday! setting the tone for the rest of the week! have a great day! you guys, i have nothing wise to say tonight! i had a fabulous weekend and got a lot done! but i am exhausted! hope you all had a great weekend!! hope you have a wonderful sunday! finally!! today i took some time to tackle my office! i have lived in my house for almost two years and it's definitely the room that has been neglected the most! i had a few pleasant interruptions...trip to mankato and lunch with my mom, setting up my new tvs, and of course stopping to look at old pictures i found! i am so excited to finally have a space to do my work instead of sitting in a recliner in the living room! pretty boring saturday, but the weather wasn't very cooperative today anyway. feels so good to get such a big task done! hope you all had a great day and did something that you wanted to do! write your own story! make it a great day! earlier this week...just heading out the door to go play cards and figure out what to do with a doctor’s stethoscope! have a great weekend everyone! so happy to be off work this weekend! happy friday! did you get your water in today? the body benefits from water in so many ways! stay hydrated friends! thirsty thursday! get your water in today! today let’s talk nutrition! i hate the word diet! your “diet” is about nutrition and fueling your body with what it needs to operate! it is not a fad! it is not starvation! it is not a quick fix! it is a lifestyle! it is also not just salads like my picture! that was only a third of my lunch! has anyone ever told you to eat more to lose weight? it’s amazing when you fuel your body with the right foods, how your body responds! eating healthy doesn’t have to be hard. it should never be restrictive! eating the right foods at the right time maximizes how your body works! we have the tools you need to set you up for success! let me know what questions you have! make good food choices today! your body will thank you! put me in coach! beautiful afternoon to watch my nephews baseball game! want to learn more about this health coaching gig i speak of? interested in learning how you can become a part of it? our team is hosting a coaching sneak peek tomorrow right here on facebook! let me know and i'll get you added to the group! make a difference today! make it a great one! some say it takes 21 days to build a new habit. i agree! i started my transformation with a 21 day program and i haven't stopped since! it's really crazy how fast 21 days can pass! another new habit i've formed is wearing these darn glasses! i look at pictures without them and don't even recognize myself! as much as i've gotten attached to these old glasses, they will officially be gone in two weeks! so excited to continue to improve my health and my life, however little these changes may be to others, they truly are life changing for me! make new habits! change your routine! you’ll be glad you did! hope you all had a happy easter! i was able to spend the day with my family, minus a few who had to work! i only took one picture of my meal! but you know what? i’m ok with that! why? because we were engaged as a family without the use of technology! sometimes it’s nice just to have the memories! hope you had a blessed day! he is risen! he is risen indeed! @j.scottlarson happy easter! blessings to you all! think about how many times you've taken the easy path only to wish you'd chosen differently. on this eve of easter, think about the ultimate sacrifice that was given for you. i'm pretty sure that jesus did not take the easy path. he took the right one. so that all of us who believe will have eternal life. so think about that the next time you have to make a difficult decision. will you take the easy path or the right path? have a great day! some days...some mornings, i just don't want to! we all have those days, right? what i've found is that nobody is going to do it for me! no one can do it for me! if you want something in life, it's on you. push yourself, even when you don't feel like it. and you know what? you will be glad you did! happy friday!! push yourself today! who can honestly say that they love what they do for a living? maybe more than i think, but i know there are many that don't! i know that every day that i get up i'm going to influence someones life. whether it be a patient or their family member. that’s pretty cool! what's even cooler than that? i get to help even more people every day through my coaching business! today i also received my first rank advancement as a coach! i have officially gone emerald! are you looking for more in life? are you looking for a way to help others while you help yourself? if you're at all interested in this coaching business that i talk about, my team will be hosting an online happy hour next wednesday! let me know! would love for you to join us! what an awesome thing to actually love what you do every day! i'm telling you right now, stop with the negative thoughts! they are only detrimental to you! and they're not accurate! i can tell you this, you're probably the only one thinking that stupid thought anyway! if you wouldn't honestly say it to someone else, then why would you say it to yourself? don't let your own mind keep you prisoner. stay positive friends! be kind to yourself. free your mind. you deserve it! treat yourself with compassion and grace! you’ve got this! i am so excited for all the new people that are joining me on their journey! challenge group starts tomorrow! it's so helpful at keeping me accountable too! i can't wait to watch how these challengers grow mentally and physically over the next few weeks! after all it's not always about what you lose, but about what you gain in the process! what do you have to lose? literally and figuratively! don’t be afraid to take that first step! try something new, it just may change your life! wrapping up another group tomorrow! it's amazing how quickly time passes! this month i did not lose any weight but i did not gain any weight! pretty good, considering i spent a week on vacation! measurements are about the same. what does that tell me? i've hit the dreaded plateau! i am not at my goal weight yet, although realistically, in a healthy range now. i know that i need to dial in my nutrition, increase my water intake, increase my weights and continue to rock these awesome workout programs! our next group starts on wednesday! who's with me? always live your best life and you will inspire others along the way. have a great monday! thankfulness. i really thought about this today. what am i thankful for? first, i am thankful for my health. the last two years around this time i’ve had recurrent illness lasting for months. so far no sign of recurrence this year! second, i am thankful for all the supportive people in my life. family, friends, coworkers and the kindness of strangers. i have required a lot of extra support over the last few years. so thank you! third, i am thankful for the opportunity to forever grow and change. i’m nowhere near where i want to be yet. but i know i’ve already come a long way. as long as i continue to fail forward, i will continue to progress on this journey. i hope you all had a blessed day. what are you thankful for? have a wonderful sunday! my goodness! what an amazing day! 3 short months ago when i decided to go active as a coach, i attended my first super saturday. i was brand new to the business. i had never worked out with anyone, let alone in public! and there i was in a room of over 1000 like minded individuals doing it! here we are 3 months later and today i attended my second super saturday. it was so great to spend time with these people again, especially my team members! i know a lot has changed for me in the last 3 months, physically, emotionally, mentally, all areas of my life. i am so very grateful for all of these amazing people i have met along the way. there's no stopping me now! does this sound like something you'd enjoy? always looking for individuals to join our team or if anything, you can be my guest at the next super saturday! if you’d like more information, please follow the link in my bio! happy saturday!! do you ever give yourself credit for what you're doing right? do you ever think about things that are going well? do you think about what you truly love about yourself? why is it that we are so quick to point out our own shortcomings? maybe you've gained a few pounds. maybe you didn't get that new job you were hoping for. maybe your dinner didn't turn out quite as planned. so what?! would you point that out to a friend or family member? would you speak to a friend or family member in the same way you speak to yourself? we are all a work in progress. allow yourself some grace. try to think about all the positives in your life! it doesn't mean you still can't hope and dream for more, does it? always be kind! especially to yourself! treat yourself as you would treat others! starting today... it’s really easier than we make it! what is one thing you absolutely love about yourself? think about it today! anyone notice a trend in my water consumption?! unfortunately, i've returned to drinking more diet soda than i should. i need to get back on track with my water intake in order to continue to progress towards my goals. stay hydrated friends! great reminder today! as for that watersnowice outside....that could stop at any time! no power or heat here. stay safe and warm midwest friends! hospice care. what i've done for the last 8 years. some people get it, some don't. a lot of people say they could never do what i do. but you know what? we only die once. why wouldn't you want it to be the best experience possible? there are so many different types of nursing. but i know that i've found my place. excited that we are adding more positions to our team! back to work today! love my job! have a great day! yesterday was not a good day. today was much better. had a lot of things to get done and actually quite a few weird things that happened. put on my big girl britches and made it a great day! back to work tomorrow! today is a new day! stand back up and try again! you guys, today...i lost my shit! my day started out on a good note. got to sleep in a little. read my personal development. got my workout in. drank my shake for breakfast. and then it all went downhill. and i let it continue to snowball...for hours! it's so tough sometimes when you feel as if you're doing the right thing. when you're trying to make good choices. when you're trying to improve your life. and nothing seems to work out right. i swear, sometimes the harder you try for good, the more you experience the bad. but the moral of the story is i got myself out of this funk. i cried when i needed to more than once today. i let it go. i took in some vitamin d sunshine style. and just allowed myself some grace. we can't be on 247 no matter how much we want to or think we can. we all have our moments. allow yourself some grace. embrace the moment. and move on. stay strong my friends! we’ve got this! what choices are you making to change your life today? never miss a monday! make it great! you know why i love drinking theses shakes every day? they seriously keep me full and satisfied for hours! they taste amazing! full of amazing superfoods, prebiotics and probiotics! they curb my nasty sweet tooth! if you expressed interest in joining our free facebook group on snacking, i’ve sent your invite! if you’re interested in learning more, send me a message! have a blessed day! looks like the sun may shine! today i had a very busy day at work! lots of windshield time! so i chose to make the best of it and jam out! cause who wouldn’t want to carpool karaoke and get paid for it! maybe i’ll get brave and post some videos! make the best of every opportunity and always choose happiness! it’s a rainy, gloomy day and i’m off to work soon! but today i choose happiness! it is so easy to come up with reasons as to why we can't work out, why we can't take time for ourselves, or why we can't eat healthy. i don't have the time. i'm too busy. yet we all have the same 24 hours in a day! i can't commit. you're choosing not to! i'm scared what others will think of me. you can do it in the comfort of your own home! i can't eat vegetables. unless you have a lot of allergies, you can eat vegetables, you just may not like some of them. i have such and such limitations. there are modifications! to me, plain and simple, these are excuses! excuses we make for ourselves. yet the only person we are limiting is ourselves! i work full time. i have pcos. i have hypothyroidism. i suffer from anxiety and depression. if i can still get it done, so can you. if it can work for me, it can work for you. don't stand in your own way! stop making excuses and start making choices that will improve your life! make it happen! happy friday! have a great day! last night some of the family got together to celebrate a few birthdays! this was my one chance to get a photo! great food, even better company! thankful for my family! so the other day i was at a local business and was greeted by someone i took care of back in my years at the local hospital. get this i haven't worked at the hospital full time in over 8 years! this person has always remembered me as having been their nurse. one time i was at a local festival and was greeted by a former patient i couldn't remember...which always makes me feel bad, however, they went on to state that they had received their liver transplant and were doing fantastic! we see patients at their worst. we rarely see them at their best! it just always amazes me that just doing your job can make such an impact in someones life. i may not always remember names, i'm much better with faces, but just know, everyone that i have taken care of has touched me in some way as well. we all have so much to learn and gain from our interactions with others. don't every let anything get in the way of that! have a great day friends! you guys, nobody can do it for you, but we can support each other along the way! we have an awesome free group that will be starting next week! seriously it's called snack attack! who gets those munchies in the middle of the day? in the evening? in the middle of the night? could you benefit from daily tips on healthy snacking? how about different snack ideas for different times of the day? on the go? how about some easy take and go snacks? there may even be some prize giveaways! message me if you'd like me to add you! we will be starting next monday! it may not always be easy, but show up and get it done! last night i took and passed my certification exam for our newest nutrition program! what does this mean? i have chosen to go above and beyond in order to ensure that i am better able to meet the needs of my customers! this program is so amazing! they have even included specific education and plans for vegan, paleo, prepost natal nutrition and finally included kids! personally i'm excited for the 75 kid-approved recipes provided because don't we all want to eat the fun stuff once in awhile?! now we can do it in a healthier way! also included is the second volume of the cookbook. between the two cookbooks and the cooking show, you have access to over 300 healthy recipes! whether you're interested in learning about portion control, food addiction, emotional eating, losing weight or just eating a balanced diet...this program has you covered! i can also save you off the retail price! interested? you know how to find me! exciting things are happening today! there’s still time to join us! make it a great monday! what do you turn to when you're going through difficult times? is it healthy or unhealthy? who do you turn to when you're going through difficult times? again, is it a healthy relationship or unhealthy relationship? although we may not be able to control what is happening to us. we can control how we are handling it! surround yourself with people and things that bring you joy and that support you in the tough times. it will definitely make whatever you're going through seem just a little bit easier! have faith in what will be! have a blessed sunday! how many of you have battled with anxiety and depression? i think we all have to some extent whether it be situational or a true diagnosis. i personally have and do battle with both. but what you can't see is that not only am i changing on the outside, i'm also changing on the inside. sure, i'll probably always deal with anxiety and depression. i may always take medications to control these symptoms. but i can tell you this. my mental health has improved far more than any physical trait that you may see. i am learning to be happy again. i am learning that it's o.k. to do things for me. that i am actually deserving of these things and more! these challenge groups i speak of are so supportive! not only do we focus on physical health through fitness and nutrition, but also personal development, goals and lifestyle. best therapy i’ve ever had! we’ve all overcome obstacles in our lives. no matter how big or how small, we all come out on the other side changed and stronger! have a great saturday! this is one of the last pictures i took in california! before i left my phone there! happy to say i got it back today!! expensive lesson but so happy to have my pictures and what not! one of the best parts of this journey i've been on is all the awesome new people that i have met! i can tell you that they truly inspire me! their stories, their motivation, their commitment, their consistency! it is truly an honor to be a part of such an amazing group of people! some of these people just got back from a cruise that they earned through this company. how fricken cool is that?! i hope to join them some day! in the meantime, i hope that some how, some way, i can be that person for others as well. who do you want at your side supporting you? who do you want to be? want to join us? happy friday! who do you want to be? who do you want to surround yourself with? making life great! do you know a lot of times when you feel hunger you're actually just thirsty? do you know that most people are actually dehydrated? do you know what percent of your body is water? do you realize the benefits of staying well hydrated? do you know how much water you're actually supposed to drink per day? to some people this may not be a no-brainer. honestly i thought i knew too! however, i've learned so much more through the program i'm following! we also have some great prepost workout supplements that focus on staying hydrated and replacing those electrolytes we lose through exercise! would you like to learn more? drop a below! everything takes water to live and grow! stay hydrated friends! when i first started my journey, i jumped all in. and i'm so glad i did! i know that there is no way that i would still be on this journey if i hadn't. and now i'm in a position where i'm helping others with something i recently didn't know i could even do myself! that is pretty cool! of course it isn't easy when you want to help others so badly, yet they don't want it for themselves. don't get me wrong i totally get it! that was me for so many years! just know that it is an investment in your total well being! even cooler? you can literally earn enough money to pay for your own products! want to know what this is about? send me a dm! go ahead! let me see you do it! definitely been feeling down since returning from vacation! can't wait for this weather to continue to warm up and for the sun to shine! first day back to work today too which is always fun. trying to keep a positive mindset. so today i created my own sunshine. i hope that others saw it! happy tuesday! back to work for me today! need that inner sunshine! have you ever sat back and truly thought about how every decision you make ultimately changes your whole life? what if you were too scared to introduce yourself to that girl or guy who turned out to be your best friend or your spouse? what if you hadn't said yes to that scary but exciting new job opportunity? what if you hadn't stopped for that cup of coffee before heading to work, when a horrible accident just happened on the highway you travel? in a way it's kind of scary to think about all the what ifs. so much of life is out of our control. but so much of our life is under our control. choose to be healthy. choose to be the best version of yourself. and always be kind! development sorry so late! still on california time. enjoyed sleeping in on my last day off! food for thought today! the raw, unfiltered me! sometimes i let life get me down. i think we all do. so what can we do differently? bad times will still happen. bad things will still happen. we can't change that. but what we can do if accept what is, give it to god, let it go and have faith. those burdens are not yours to carry my friend. have a great sunday! you all know that recently i have found something that has literally changed my life! it doesn't matter what we've been through, i am positive that there is something out there for all of us. we may not always understand the timing. we may not always understand the reason. but until then, make the most of every moment of every day! someday it will all make sense! have a great saturday! make good memories today and every day! it rained most of the day today so it was mostly spent inside the hotel room! sad that this is how we spent our last day in california, but... the sun came out for a few hours late this afternoon. and boy did we soak it up! looks like rain today in california. thoughts and prayers for all of those back home dealing with the flooding. so my hotel advertises a gym...but there is none. that and along with the fact i’m on vacation has made it very difficult to work out. i have modified i.e. no weights but i have pushed through. although i may not be seeing the results i would want over a weeks time, i’m not going to let anything stop me. you see, this is a lifestyle change, not a fad or a diet. a truly better version of life in all areas. what is stopping you? never quit. never give up! make it a great day! as i said in my post this morning, today we honored and remembered my grandfather ray. unfortunately just as we arrived to the mission my mom received a call informing her that her former coworker had passed this morning. so today we honored and remembered him as well. how do you live your life? do you play it safe? do you live life to the fullest, experiencing every opportunity that arises? do you truly show up to your job and feel satisfied on a daily basis? do you love your family and friends with your whole heart? do you love yourself? life is short. live your life and leave your mark on the world. think about how people will remember you. how do you honor and remember those who have gone before? do you feel their presence in your life? do they still show up in your memories and dreams? tonight take some time to honor those who have gone before us...gone but never forgotten! today is the anniversary of my grandfathers death. i never got to meet him. he was stationed in california during part of his military career. today is also the day that the swallows return to the mission at san juan capistrano. today we will be spending time celebrating and remembering him at the mission. have a blessed day and may your loved ones live on through you! lovedones hope you all had a great day! we spent our day searching for whales and dolphins! because why not! if you never try how will you ever succeed? happy monday! emojis may indicate what i’m doing today! also, our newest nutrition program launches today! who wants to try? today was a pool day! so happy to be enjoying some nice weather and we had the pool to ourselves! like my post this morning stated, it's not always about what you lose but, instead what you gain. throughout my journey the biggest changes i have noticed are my feelings of finally being comfortable in my own skin and the confidence that has come with it! i find myself walking a little taller and getting out of my comfort zone more often. i am truly so much happier than i have been in a long time and am enjoying the journey! are you living your life or are you just getting by? would you like to start your own journey to happiness? we have an awesome nutrition program launching tomorrow! you're not going to want to miss it! you know how to reach me! have a great day! i’m out here living my life!! today i traveled to california with my mom. we will be spending a week here checking off an item on her bucket list! more to come! hope you’re all having a great weekend! can’t wait for my adventure today! have a great weekend everyone! you guys, we all have our crap. we've all fought our battles. we all have our baggage. it's what we chose to do with it where we can shine! we can keep it all bundled up inside causing us pain. we can keep complaining and do nothing about it. or, we can use it as fuel to grow and change! don't let life get you down. take whatever you're experiencing and turn it into something positive! happy friday!! can we talk about this weather? it has definitely been a long winter. more snow than we've seen in years. now this, rain! but you know what that means? the weather is changing. the temperatures are warming. spring is coming! so although the skies are grey and the precipitation and wind just don’t stop. i'm choosing to be happy because i know better days are ahead and my sump pump is keeping up! stay safe out there my friends! also, happy pi day! happy thursday! what are you happy for today? all words and actions have the ability to leave lasting imprints on our hearts and soul. although you may not remember the exact words that were said or exactly how something was done, i bet you'll remember how it made you feel. whether it be in your home life or work life, think about this in your words and actions every day. make it a great day! make someone truly feel loved and appreciated today! i was recently asked by a friend, how do you stay motivated? it was actually quite easy to answer! 1. results! i have lost almost 20 pounds and kept it off since starting these programs. not only that, but my muscles are more toned, clothes fit better, etc. 2. it just feels good! i know that how i move my body and how i fuel my body will determine how i feel. and i'm done feeling like crap. 3. support! our accountability groups offer such incredible support and daily motivation. bonus they are fun! it is important to surround yourself with like minded individuals. you guys, i feel the best i've felt in my life....and my goal moving forward is to be that inspiration and motivation for you! what motivates you on a daily basis? don't let what you do in the kitchen defeat the purpose of your workouts! our awesome new nutrition program is launching soon! i am currently working on my certification for this program and am so excited! i'm excited because it means i'll be able to help out my customers that much more! they will also be re-taping two of my favorite workout programs! how cool is that?! interested in learning more? we invite you to join our free facebook group! if you want me to add you to the group drop a below! today we also start prep week for our march madness challenge group! can't wait for all my former and new customers to experience some amazing transformations over the next few weeks! monday is already here again. make some healthy choices today! today i was thankful for having the ability to work from home! and it wasn't too busy which was even better! today i've been thinking a lot of not only the patients and families that i serve, but also all of my friends and coworkers who have lost too many loved ones in the past few hours, days and months. may you find comfort and peace during these difficult times. let us live our life to the fullest, not just for ourselves, but in honor and remembrance of those who have gone too soon. blessed sunday to you all! take it all in. today i was determined to get up earlier than usual! why? 1. i wanted to make sure that i had time to take care of myself this morning. got my workout done and my healthy breakfast in on the way to work. 2. i wanted to ensure that i was able to take care of my patient's today before the weather turned. 3. i wanted to do all this and be able to get home safely! it may not seem like much to anyone else, but i know that today i accomplished what i set out to do...and tonight i will go to bed satisfied! have a great day! our march challenge group is starting soon! last call for challengers! even if nutrition and fitness aren't your thing or you've never really focused on your health before. these groups are for people at all levels. trust me, when i started this was all new to me! we will be following a sports bracket where you will earn points for the activities you complete! it's going to be fun with great prizes for the winner! prep week starts on monday. challenge group officially starts on march 18th! i continue on my own journey...join me! happy friday! what can you start today that will change your life? one thing that we highly encourage our coaches and customers to focus on is personal development. this may mean a podcast, a book, devotionals, journaling, meditating, etc. so today i highly encourage you to unplug. take a few minutes of your day, whether it be 10 or 30, and focus on you. it's actually a lot harder than it sounds but gets easier the more you do it! what can you learn? what areas can you improve on? make it a great day everyone! yesterday i received my official hospice and palliative care certification renewal certificate in the mail! i have been working in hospice for 8 years and have been certified for the last 4! i am very grateful to all the good hearts that i work with every day. my coworkers, my patients and their families! of course it isn't always easy but i know that this is my calling. very similar to my nursing career, coaching is allowing me to help others in a different way! there are so many opportunities available, and also, just like nursing, i am grateful for all the new coworkers and challengers that i share this journey with! we are always looking for others to join us! if you're interested in a coaching opportunity and helping others to be the best version of themselves, send me a dm! may everything you do today come from a good place! don't complain about things you're not willing to change. that's the quote i posted this morning. i could definitely take a lesson from this! although i've been making significant changes in my life, i know there is still room for improvement. i've learned to accept my life for what it is in the present. but in no way is my journey complete! i will continue to grow along the way! everything happens for a reason. everything happens at the right time. i know that the best is yet to come and i'm looking forward to it! how about you? i'm now taking applicants for my march boot camp! prep week starts 311 and group officially starts 318! let me know if you're interested! what changes can you make today? make it a great one! never miss a monday! i've said it before and i'll say it again! it totally sets the tone for the rest of the week. consistency is key! you may not notice big differences from day to day. but, i guarantee you that if you show up daily, put the work in and keep your nutrition in check, one day you'll finally notice! whether it be a change in the scale, how your clothes are fitting, measurements, etc. again, success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out. have a great monday! today i was too lazy to actually get out and go to church! luckily in this day and age a lot of churches stream their services. today i had the pleasure of taking in two different services. the moral of the story? check out psalm 139. trust the journey. enjoy the process. have faith in what will be! have a very blessed sunday everyone! were you present in your activities today? if you never see your significant other, family member or friend again, did you make your moments memorable? did you say everything you wanted to say? did you tell them you love them? we all know that we are not promised tomorrow. live your life. don't just go through the motions. you never know which moment will be your last. so make it count! this morning i am helping out at work even though it’s my day off. i am lucky enough to work with people who definitely understand the value of every moment. today i challenge you to be truly present in whatever you do! last night i had the opportunity to attend a session about handling stress. it really got me thinking about how we choose to handle what is thrown at us day in and day out. although we may not be able to handle what happens to us, we can choose how we are going to respond to it! that's a pretty amazing thing if you think about it! we learned 12 stress-busting tips last night. they're really not that difficult, but again it's a shift in thinking, a lifestyle change. since starting my journey three months ago, i have already incorporated many of these tips! but i also still have a long way to go and am learning every day! how are you coping with the stress you encounter daily? how is it affecting your overall health? what can you do to change the way you respond to stress? you'll be amazed at how your outlook changes when you begin to focus on your own health and wellness. would love to have you join me! how do you deal with your stress and burdens? happy friday! you may hear me mention my super food shakes or see pictures of me with my shaker cup! today i wanted to share with you the benefits of drinking this daily! 1. it is so much more than just a protein shake! 2. it's a solid source of fiber and many other awesome nutrients! 3. it helps to curb cravings and helps you lose weight! 4. it's an easy grab and go food! 5. it helps take the stress out of meal planning! 6. it helps to jump-start clean eating habits! 7. lastly, it just tastes good! interested in learning more or trying it? let me know! think about how you’re fueling your body today! make it a great one! the greatest thing i feel about our nutritional programs are that they don't exclude anything! it's really all about fueling your body with the right foods at the right times. there is no calorie counting, macro counting, food group exclusions, etc. no cheating either! just treating! yes, they show you how to incorporate these special treats into your plan as well! the education provided to follow these programs is top notch. they even provide recipes and meal planning ideas! it makes it so simple!! and you guys, it doesn't have to be difficult! a few simple swaps, watching your portion sizes. seriously, just being mindful about what you put in your mouth. and track it! what works for you? what doesn't work for you? tweak it from there! if you're interested in more information, shoot me a message! no fad diets here! changing your lifestyle is where it’s at! can you name one thing that you do for yourself on a daily basis. how do you take care of you? we are often so busy taking care of those around us that we get the most important person! ourself! if we are not taking care of ourselves and living our best lives, it will be impossible to continue to care for everyone else. it is not selfish. in fact you are giving those around you the greatest gift ever the best version of you!! take a few minutes this evening or tomorrow morning to do something for yourself that will bring you joy. you can’t pour from an empty cup! @sweepstakes happy tuesday! nutrition matters. mental health matters it’s all about health! motivational monday today i want you to ask yourself what motivates you? would it be the opportunity to make yourself healthier? be the best mom or dad you can be? the best husband or wife you can be? a better coworker, employee, friend, roommate? just being true to yourself? or is it something more measurable movement on the scale? inches lost? money? i can almost guarantee you that if you choose to say yes, you will notice changes in all of these areas! no regrets, just results! never miss a monday! it sets the tone for the week. started a new program today and got my butt kicked! love it! have a great day my friends! hope everyone is staying safe and warm during these blizzard conditions! today i am so grateful for the convenience of at home workouts! no having to warm up the car, bundle up and venture out on these dangerous roads! because of this i was able to complete my current program today!! there are so many great ones to choose from! it will be hard to pick a new program, but i know whichever one i choose will be worth it and i'll see results! happy sunday funday! be careful out there today folks! it doesn’t look nice! what is it that makes you tick? what makes you love life? do you have dreams and aspirations? are you courageous enough to go after it? i never would have considered myself courageous by any means. but my opinion of that has changed. a few months ago i decided to step way out of my comfort zone and start a nutrition and fitness program. taking that step was huge for me. i had never really focused on my nutrition and never followed any type of fitness routine. now it is something that i crave more of! that being said, i stepped out of my comfort zone even further by choosing to take on a role as a wellness coach. it has been an amazing journey so far. i am meeting so many like minded people that are just as enthused about health and wellness as i have become! do you have the courage to step outside of your comfort zone? are you pushing yourself daily to lead your best life? looking for help along the way? shoot me a dm! would love to watch you live a life you love! happy saturday! what are you doing for fun today? a friend of mine posted a quote the other day to the effect of there are 7 days in a week someday isn't one of them! we tend to dream of the future instead of living in the moment. why do we wait to pursue goals that are so important to us? i understand, sometimes there are real barriers financially, physically, etc, but most of the time it's mind over matter. quit waiting for the right time to take care of you! life is short. there may never be a right time. the time is now my friends! happy friday everyone! we’re only given one life. let’s live!! self sabotage. it’s real. my weight loss has been stalled for 3 weeks. lose a pound, gain two. lose two, gain one. yes. i’ve been losing the same 1-2 pounds for almost 3 weeks now! i’m getting my workouts in daily. it’s my nutrition that has been off. enter emotional eating, extra “treats” and girl scout cookies! enough said. i also found myself drinking more diet soda again and not getting my water in. every once in awhile we just need to take a moment and really review what we are doing. it’s so easy to get complacent. so tonight my friends let’s reflect and recharge. tomorrow is a new day! are you choosing water first? are you drinking enough water throughout the day? stay hydrated friends! wellness wednesday! today i wanted to share a few tricks that i use on a daily basis to keep my nutrition in check! 1. always think about vegetables first! often times we fill up on carbs and proteins. although they're important, we probably don't need as much as we are actually eating! 2. think about healthy alternatives! i like to swap cauliflower rice for white rice, spaghetti squash for noodles, greek yogurt for sour cream... if you really think about it, there's probably some easy swaps you can make as well! 3. are you really hungry or just bored? a lot of times we eat out of boredom or habit. seriously just stop and think about it for a minute! in the meantime, drink some water! 4. always choose water over other beverages! 5. prep your fruit and veggies as soon as you get home from the store! you will be more likely to reach for the healthy options if the prep work is already done! 6. eating out? order something that will make good leftovers and ask for that to-go container at the start of your meal! that way you can portion it out and keep yourself from over eating. 7. make a shopping list and stick to it the healthiest foods are on the perimeter of the grocery store. try to avoid the inside aisles! eating healthy can seem like a daunting task at times when there are so many easy, unhealthy choices to make. there are many already prepared frozen meat choices, frozen and canned fruit, etc. don't make it difficult! your body will thank you for it! make healthy choices today! it may just turn into a habit! i rarely talk specific products, but today was an exciting day! our pre-workout drink has only been available in lemon until today! today they introduced fruit punch!! seriously it will make you push harder and you will maximize your results! bonus it’s so much better for you than an energy drink! my order is already in! today was the official start of this month’s challenge group! so excited to share this journey with those of you who’ve decided to join me! these accountability groups have been the key i’ve needed to keep me focused and help me stay on track! it’s a bonus that along the way i’m meeting so many new people. as my post stated this morning your circle should clap the loudest, if not, get a new one! interested in joining us? you know where to find me! happy monday! make it a great day! today as i drove through a neighboring town, i saw a home for sale. of course there was a sign in the yard, but one like i’ve never seen before. it stated “beautiful inside”. it seriously made me think. how do i market myself? what do i show others? that’s all fine and dandy, but do i feel beautiful on the inside? even though we are good at “putting on a show” for the outside world, i believe we all have room to do better on the inside. we are our own worst critics. be true to yourself and let your inner beauty shine! sunday fun day! just kidding, i’m still working! 24 hours until my weekend starts! be safe if you’re out and about today! rocking the scrubs today! “we cannot change the outcome, but we can affect the journey.” ann richardson happy saturday! what’s everyone doing for their soak today? i’ll be busy taking care of patients! have a great day! happy friday everyone! weekends can be hard. we get out of our normal routine. maybe we are away from home, eating out, running here and there... my advice is to get up and get those workouts in early. make healthy choices for your meals. pack healthy snacks to take with you. consistency is key! this weekend i will be working! so my routine will stay the same! wishing you all a safe and fun weekend! now is the time! happy friday! happy valentine's day! on a day known for chocolate, cards, flowers, and love, let's take a moment to just be still. take a few minutes to think about all of those in your life who you have loved and who have loved you. did you include yourself? self-love is so important! and this happens to be what we are focusing on in our accountability group this month! official start is on monday! would love to have you join us! happy valentines day everyone! i find that a lot of times we tend to focus on what we don't have, what we want, maybe even what we need but can't afford. being grateful, however, costs us nothing. what can you be grateful for today? do you have a roof over your head? electricity? running water? heat? food in your cupboards? a job to go to even if you don't particularly care for it? health? take a minute right now to truly think about all of the things you can be grateful for! happy wednesday! have a great day! i have appreciated the support that i have received from all of you when i've shown some of my progress pictures! thank you! i wish i had the words to describe how i have changed on the inside. feeling full used to mean i'd overstuffed myself with food, was bloated, or maybe had a few too many drinks or maybe just at my wits end... these days feeling full is a completely different feeling! full of joy, gratefulness, confidence, etc! i still have bad days i am human, but i am becoming happier than i've been in a long time! i recently read a quote that stated: surround yourself with people that reflect who you want to be and how you want to feel, energies are contagious. who is in your tribe? one of the most helpful pieces of motivation i have found is through our accountability groups! it is a safe place for coaches and their challengers to share their struggles, what's going right, healthy snacks and recipes, good prep tips, silly challenges, etc. even some free giveaways at times! daily check-ins to log workouts and super food shakes definitely keep me accountable and motivate me to be a good example as a coach! the feeling of being supported by people who are on the same journey is amazing! we have started our prep week today and officially kick off next week! there's still time to join us! times will get tough. we will all have bad days. what is it that will keep you going? the most beautiful rainbows follow a storm! make it a great monday! health and wellness doesn’t just have to be about weight loss! there are so many non-scale victories to celebrate! i am losing inches, gaining muscle and my mood and self confidence have been boosted immensely! sometimes the greatest successes can’t be seen, but only felt. don’t let the scale get you down! keep showing up. keep working hard. the results will come. consistency is key! our february accountability group is right around the corner! prep week starts on monday! would love to get you hooked up asap so you’re ready to go when we officially start on 218! let me know if you want to reserve you a spot! this is what i am working on personally this week! what is holding you back? what excuses do you tell yourself? what could you change today that would affect your life in a positive way? sometimes all it takes is one small thing to make all the difference in the world! these pictures were updated over a week ago but i was just too afraid to post. i thought i hadn’t “changed” enough for anyone to notice or be proud of. but that was my mistake right there. it was my own self doubt holding me back. i was being my own worst critic. the fact of the matter is that it doesn’t matter what anyone thinks or says. this is my journey, my body and my life to live. it has lit a new fire in me and i will continue to succeed! this right here was published one year ago today. i guarantee it has changed many women’s lives! personal development is so important for your overall health. your body can physically be perfect. but if you’re destroying yourself in your mind, how healthy are you? i will have the privilege of hearing her speak in july and i can’t wait! there’s still time to join me. ask me how! we can’t pour from an empty cup! how do you fill yours? my favorite quote of all times! what does your future look like? what dreams do you have for yourself and those you love? share your favorite quote below. would love to see them! last call for participants in our free group! we officially start tomorrow!! focusing on personal development this month with the five love languages! no need to purchase the book! just plug in a couple minutes a day to our group to learn more and develop your relationships with those you love! send me a message if you’re interested but haven’t been invited yet! how cool is this?! finishing up this months accountability group on top! looking for challengers for my next group. officially starts on 218 with prep week starting 211! would be great to get you on board asap so that you have all the tools you need to start the group off right! february is team cup month for us! really just a great chance to get more people involved in the lifestyle we have come to love! i didn’t know these 4 ladies until just a few days ago. we are part of a greater team of coaches who have partnered up to crush our goals! that’s what this journey is all about! meeting others who share a common interest in health and wellness and inspiring others along the way! how awesome is that? would love for you to join us! and absolutely loving it! thank you to all my awesome coworkers! it truly takes a team! can you say you love your job? what gives you purpose and passion in life? looking for something more to fill your cup? i may be able to help! always looking to help more people on their journey! it must be the nurse in me! you guys it doesn’t have to be hard to eat right! literally half a bag of frozen stir fry veggies. handful of frozen shrimp. seasonings of choice. dinner is served! don’t make it harder than it is! we have some great nutrition plans that give you so many great ideas and recipes! and it’s so simple! one day left to receive $30 off the nutrition program i am following!! i know it’s super cold out but what an inspirational quote for today! how do you fuel your body, mind and soul? true beauty, happiness and sunshine starts on the inside! and a little workout to warm you up probably wouldn’t hurt! join me on my journey! it will change your life! early registration is now open for my next accountability group! do you really want to miss out on another month? message me for details! today i want to give a shout out to this guy! my older brother. he has been on his own journey for at least a year now! and look at his results! he is doing a different program than i am but that’s the cool thing about health and wellness. everyone can find their own programs and routines that work well for them! i am so proud of this guy right here for all the hard work he has done to get this far! funny thing how life changes...we now talk over veggies and healthy recipes instead of beer! it happens to be a special day for him today too! so head on over to his page and give him some birthday love! we all have our reasons for doing what we do. how can you be a better version of yourself? would this allow you to be a better mom, dad, wife, husband, brother, sister, coworker, friend? what is your why? think about it! and when you’re ready, let me know! happy birthday @j.scottlarson!! have a great day! we focus a lot on personal development in our groups! after all if your mind isn’t healthy your body can’t be either. since we celebrate valentines day in february our focus for this months free facebook group will be the 5 love languages by gary chapman. i will start sending invites out tomorrow to those of you who’ve already expressed an interest. if you’d like to join us drop a below! would love to have you! happy sunday! january is already drawing to an end. how are you doing with those new year’s resolutions? i’m still looking to help 2 more people yet this month! only 5 days left!! comment or send me a message if you’re interested in joining me! what is this? my supper! i’ve hit a plateau this last week with my weight loss. food like this doesn’t help! however, i started with my salad. could barely finish this one piece of pizza. and didn’t go back for more! that’s still a win in my book! no cheats, just treats! weekends are definitely hard. today might not be a weight loss day, but tomorrow i can start all over and get back on track! how awesome is that?! warmed up with piyo and cardio this morning! then indulged in my superfood shake! so good! cold and snowy here today! hope everyone stays safe and warm! make it a great day! hope you all had a fabulous friday! i know i am so ready for the weekend! i always make my workouts a priority first thing in the morning! that way there’s no excuse and the rest of the day is free to do whatever is planned or whatever comes up! when will you get your exercise in this weekend? seriously! only one week left to save on my favorite nutrition plan! this is the plan that has allowed me to drop 14 lbs in the last 6 weeks! no counting, no measuring. just using the knowledge provided to fuel your body correctly! reach out to me if you’re interested in learning more! it is not a diet. it’s a lifestyle change! the changes i have experienced internally far outweigh the physical changes. you have to put yourself first, believe in yourself and love yourself. no more excuses! although i’m still new to this journey, i have no intentions of giving up any time soon! this summer i will have the chance to travel to indy with thousands of other like minded individuals. keynote speakers like rachel hollis will be in the house! how cool is that? there is still time to join me on this journey and earn your way there for free! never stop dreaming!! dreams do become reality!! never miss a monday! it sets the tone for the whole week! that being said wowza! i started a new workout program this morning and it kicked my butt! i guess nobody ever said it would be easy! but i did it. and tomorrow i will get up and push play again. because that’s what it takes. and i will not give up! sometimes this is hard, we all know that! but i am learning and growing every day! that’s what this journey is about! it’s not just the physical changes that people see on the outside. it’s also about the way this lifestyle changes you on the inside! it is not an easy task but it can be done! the best part is that the more you believe in yourself, the more others will believe in you too! take a look in the mirror. that’s your only competition! so stop with the self doubt and start chasing your dreams! what an awesome tribe of women and men i am getting to know! i am so happy that i took this leap of faith! some of you may not get it, some of you may doubt me, some of you could probably care less. but i know my tribe is already forming and i can’t wait for what the future holds! free groups and challenge groups will be forming soon! stay tuned for more information! just over 6 weeks into my journey and 14 lbs lost forever. of course i still have more weight to lose to get to my goal... however, i am most satisfied with what i have gained in the last month and a half. happiness, health, energy, better sleep, a supportive group of like minded individuals and most of all confidence! i have no intentions of slowing down now! wellness wednesday! 2 months ago i would never have posted about my diet. mcdonalds drive thru for breakfast, another fast food joint for lunch, frozen pizza for supper and don’t forget to throw in about a gallon of diet coke! then in december i took a leap of faith and joined a new fitness and nutrition program. and i can tell you i will never go back to my old ways! i may still eat out, but i make different choices. tonight’s dinner was my version of chicken fajitas. tell me this doesn’t look good! this is not a diet, it is not a fad! it is a serious lifestyle change. fueling your body with the correct nutrition will change you in ways you’d never imagine! an amazing new program launched yesterday and there are more exciting things to come in the next few months! i am so glad i started my journey when i did! when will you begin yours? so you don’t like to eat your vegetables? but all this in an omelet? i bet you’d eat it! loving that my nutrition plan allows me to stay full and satisfied! correctly fueling my body at the right time, with the right nutrition has not only allowed me to shed some pounds, but also gives me so much more energy! although my journey started only recently, i have noticed so many changes not just physically but mentally and emotionally as well! spent my morning yesterday with some very inspirational people sharing the same vision! can’t wait for what the future holds! amazing day today! today i was completely out of my comfort zone. meeting many health and wellness coaches from across the state of mn. also working out with 1000 people, led by autumn calabrese herself! i have never worked out in front of or with anyone before! i had to modify at times, but that is ok! progress over perfection! can’t wait to continue to grow on this journey! you have no idea how hard that was to push post last night! thank you for all the “likes” and kind words. if you’ve expressed interest you will be hearing from me in the next few days! as for today, workout superfood shake for breakfast on my way to work make it a great day! it’s not perfect, but progress! for those of you who know me fitness, health, nutrition, etc. has never really been my thing. i never thought that i had to worry about it. after all i was too busy taking care of others as a nurse rather than caring for myself. after reaching my highest weight of 180 lbs in 2016, i went through a life changing event and dropped 45 lbs without even trying. my bad habits eventually caught up to me and my weight took off again. after reaching 170 lbs i decided it was time to do something about it! i’d been following a co-worker through her wellness journey via social media. i reached out to her for more information and that is where my journey began. in december 2018 i joined one of her challenge groups which helped to keep me accountable as i became accustomed to this new lifestyle. in 4 weeks i lost a total of 7 lbs, was working out daily and watching what i fueled my body with...and craving more! and this included a week long vacation, christmas and new years! i am already feeling so much stronger not only physically but emotionally as well. my weight loss has continued and as of today i’ve lost 9.5 lbs! this truly is a lifestyle change. there is no pill or quick fix. just hard work and dedication. for this reason, i have decided to jump into the coaching business. not only will it help to keep me accountable as i continue my own journey, it will allow me to help others on their journeys as well. if you’re interested in learning more about my journey or are interested in starting your own, drop me a message, call, text, email, etc. however you feel comfortable reaching out. looking forward to this new opportunity! bottom pictures 12118 top pictures 1119 we get it. direct sales might not be for you and that’s totally cool!! but someone in your network is looking for what we have to offer. maybe it’s the products we share, but more than likely, someone you know is looking for an additional way to make a few hundred extra bucks a month especially now that we’re entering the holiday season. truly, word of mouth and referrals are gold in our industry. sharing your friend with your network and serving as a connector is one of the most valuable things you can do to offer support and cheer on your friend. ⁣reach out and ask your friend how you can best connect them! it would mean the world! skip the application for a part time job at a retail store. you can make money from your phone, jan. anytime, anywhere, any skill set. if an extra paycheck every month would do something for you, your passing up a massive opportunity by not talking to that direct sales chick you see hustlin’ away. ⁣she’s on to something. if i had a dollar for every time someone started a direct sales business and told themselves bullshit stories before they even really tried, i’d have another solid stream of income but for real, ladies...why do we do this?! before we give it our best shot, we spend more time telling ourselves things like i’m going to bother people everyone’s going to judge me⁣ no one will want to buy my product i’m not successful enough i’m not pretty enough my audience isn’t big enough i’ve failed before, so i’ll fail again here’s what i’m asking you to do: if you’re going to spend energy on that internal dialogue, you must give equal time and energy to stories like:⁣ i have something of value to offer⁣ i am attracting all the right people of course i’ll succeed⁣ i’m going to help people people are going to see me succeed i deserve this i’m worthy because what we focus on is what comes to fruition. so give yourself a damn shot, girlfriend. you’ve got this. tag share with your teams and sideline sisters who need to hear this the cool thing about direct sales is that you can’t jump the line literally everyone starts at the same place. the bottom. everyone starts with taking the same risk, the same nerves, and the same zero sales at signing. so if you see someone killin’ the game, rather than use the most offensive phrase “she’s lucky,” know that there is no luck here. we show up and succeed on purpose and we can show you how to do the same damn thing. daily reminder: if you have time to judge or hate on someone else, you’re not spending nearly enough time working on bettering yourself. you haven’t reached out to everyone you know. you haven’t followed up with everyone. you haven’t out-sold your market. you haven’t thought of everything. this business can feel daunting, frustrating, and it can make you question your abilities. but listen to me, those are fleeting feelings, not facts. keep going. i mean, with that in mind, you’d be kind of douchebag if you don’t at least offer what you’ve got, right? source: direct selling association did ya know? while only 52 of american households earn more than $50k a year, that number goes

doing that, are you?!” that one comment sends you crashing down and questioning all your big goals and dreams. it’s not that bridget is a bad person; she just doesn’t get it. she’s buzzed on warm beer

recommendation on your social media platform favorite new amazon purchase, favorite new netflix show, favorite new restaurant, favorite a n y t h i n g but you’re not with a direct sales company, you are making a mistake. that’s all i have to say about that. you can sit with women who gossip about other women’s goals, or you can sit with women who strategize with you and encourage you to achieve yours. choose wisely. you can’t achieve success if you don’t try first. ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣we all do it, all the time. stop acting like you don’t love it, too want a raise? create it. want more time freedom? create it. want more options? create them.⁣ stop waiting for things to come to you. most often when i see people bashing our industry, their argument is “but look at the income disclosure statements ahhh!!!” um, yeah. so? if some people make a shit ton of money and a lotta people make a big fat goose egg, guess what? there are still thousands of people in the middle who are making a life changing income. “life changing” doesn’t mean “millionaire-quit-your-full time-job-and-buy-five-yachts” status. maybe that means they can now afford their kids’ dance lessons.⁣ maybe it means they can cover their car payment without taking from their main paycheck. maybe it means they can go part time at the salon now. maybe it means they have a safety net for the ebb and flow of their family business. maybe it means they’re having more fun.⁣ maybe it means they’re overcoming their anxiety by doing something outside of their comfort zone. so yeah, i see your income disclosure statement argument which, btw, is there to make sure no one feels like false promises are made but take a better look at the people in the middle. we’re changing our lives whether you want to believe it or not. you

when’s the last time anything meaningful or successful in your life was achieved in 14 days or less? um, never i’ve said it before and i’ll say it a hundred more times you cannot bash network marketing for being a “pyramid scheme” and then get pissed off and quit when you realize that it actually takes work. it’s not a get rich quick situation. it’s a business. so the next time someone says “oh yeah, i’ve tried direct sales before, it sucks” or “it wasn’t for me” or “yeah, my aunt’s neighbor’s cousin’s mailman tried direct sales and they got screwed” ask them: how long did you try before you quit? ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣source: direct selling news⁣ succeeding in direct sales it about showing up. not once, not twice. everyday. for an extended period of time. that’s it. holy mother! 5 thousand

saved money on prime day deals: take the savings and invest it into starting a side gig! win-win!⁣ it’s not with a part time job, folks. if this year has taught us anything, it’s that no one is immune to having the rug pulled out from under them. residual income doesn’t need to be your main income, but if it’s not in your financial portfolio, you’re making a mistake. residual income pays you after the initial work has been done. no, it’s not a magic bullet or a seed that plants money trees, and yes, it requires work, but it’s a financial decision that, with little upfront investment and unmatched flexibility to make it work should be a top priority for everyone. a great place to start? yep, you guessed it. your friendly network marketing boss think the investment of starting a direct sales business is expensive? the average startup cost is $80 btw think again, jan source: direct selling association the “right time” is a lie we tell ourselves. it’s an excuse, a crutch, and a reason

minutes a day for the side gig that can help you create whatever it is you’re longing for. ⁣next step: reach out to the direct sales chick who you click with and ask questions. i’ve been in this business for years, and one of the most frequent hurdleshard stops for most people is fear. fear of what their friends, family, and colleagues will think. fear of failing, publicly. fear of rejection. fear of investing in themselves. fear of growth yep, that’s real. but even looking at allllll those “scary” things which, by the way, i absolutely felt i still firmly believe it’s more terrifying to think about having missed the opportunity that not only changed my life, but the lives of hundreds of women i know, because of fear.⁣ false⁣ evidence⁣ appearing real⁣ we all my sisters in direct sales

give that a big “hell yeah.” happy sunday, ladies and gentlemen! and a doubly happy sunday to the folks who aren’t stressed about tomorrow being monday! for whoever needs this reminder pssst, you don’t need to be passionate about direct sales for it to be the thing that changes your entire life. when you get in your car to go to, say, your dream job or a date with your future spouse or the hospital to have your baby are you like...⁣ “ummm, i’m not really passionate about this ford taurus soooo imma just stay here and not go to work, go on a date, go have a doctor deliver my baby” hell no.⁣ you grab your keys and freaking go.⁣ direct sales in the same fucking thing. stop acting like you have to be passionate about the vehicle ie: skincare or shampoo in order to get your dream destination ie: quitting your part time job, paying off your student loans, having a guilt-free shopping fund. grab the keys your friendly direct sales friend and go.⁣ i’d ask for a hand raise to see who can relate, but i know none y’all are gonna out yourself for not being certain you have enough in your checking account to cover your uber eats order. but i know you’re out there, and i want you to know that starting a network marketing gig can help remedy that “oh shit, how will i make it until next payday?” feeling thinking about it is making you $0, and that sucks. direct sales isn’t some magic voodoo that turns you into an obnoxious person from high school. but, like, if you are that annoying person from high school...direct sales probably isn’t the avenue for you alexa, play truth hurts by lizzo⁣ but for real, what’s your money mindset? do you think money is “bad” or that to want i⁣⁣t makes you “greedy”?⁣ or do you believe that money is simply energy and to have more of it makes you a more impactful human? the fact of the matter is this: direct sales is unlike any other opportunity out there; the startup cost is low and the income and freedom potential is truly limitless. but here’s the thing: most people don’t genuinely believe that that type of wealth and abundance exists andor is available to them. attracting wealth and success starts first in your mind. if you go in to an experience thinking it’s shit and that you’ll fail and everyone will think you’re an idiot...guess what?⁣⁣ you’ll fail and everyone will think you’re an idiot. but what if you went into an opportunity with the acceptance that yeah, maybe you feel nervous and unsure, but you believe that you are worthy to receive all the wealth and abundance that’s already out there?⁣⁣ well then, yeah, that shit is comin’ to ya. bom bom bi dom bum bay⁣ everyone thinks you’re crazy until you actually pull it off. the key is to be one of the crazy ones, not one of bandwagon jumpers trying to play catch up. think about it. netflix.⁣ uber. air bnb. spotify. amazon. all these massive, goliath-type companies all came “out of left field.” they didn’t make sense. people thought they were crazy and bound to fail. and now? well, i think you know the answer to that one. direct sales is the future of entrepreneurial endeavors, it’s the future of how people make money, and it’s going to be maddening for you in the future when you take a look back and think, “oh, shit, i coulda been in on that years ago. i missed the boat on that one” ...as you head into your desk job that you don’t like and all your peers are out driving free cars and cultivating their own 24. ps if that last bit triggers you or stings, it doesn’t mean i’m a bitch for saying it...it means you need to look inward and figure out why could it be that you’re unhappy, unfulfilled, or not challenged enough and that mayyyybe you want to be doing what we’re doing over here? just a thought! if you want a good giggle, when someone tells you “no” to the business because they “don’t want to be salesy” take a few days and just watch their social media. they’ll recommend lip glosses and starbucks and sell the clothes out of gd their closets...⁣ and then you can call them on their bullshit and you can both laugh and laugh and laugh. nothing and i mean nothingggg about this pandemic is good, but if you’ve been looking for a silver lining or a “sign” here it is, sister. according to a little known publication called forbes, “it’s very rare that markets and consumers are all shifted in real time together. normally, trends begin slowly, starting in a few industries and in micro segments of the population and then they grow over time. with the pandemic, there have been wholesale shifts in consumer behavior, which are rapidly driving new trends across multiple industries.” yep, direct sales is one of them. business is booming because people have been shaken into a new reality. from hardship and shock and struggle has come opportunity... and, honestly, the guts to just fucking go for it. glorifying “busy” is so 2017. streamline your life, diversify your income. it’s really that simple. there’s two sides of every coin. yep, even the “that girl” coin. let’s take this gym metaphor one step further, shall we?⁣ if someone joins a gym, rarely or never goes, and continues to pay their monthly membership...its not the gym’s fault.⁣ the gym is not a scam. dare i say, the gym is there as an opportunity to better oneself...but the gym can’t make this hypothetical health goddess fit as fuck without the individual showing up, putting in the work, and even making intentional decisions outside of said gym? whoa. it’s like a grown adult is capable of making decisions and creating their own results...!?!⁣ waiting vs creating. waiting or researching or praying or hoping or wishing on a shooting star without action is a monumental waste of energy. you can create anything. literally, anything. so if a $1,200 check would rock your world, go freaking create it. find the person who’s already creating it for herself, ask her what it takes, and then humble yourself for a minute to be coachable enough to learn from a professional. waiting without action is an insult to yourself. you’ve got everything you need, readily available at your fingertips literally to create whatever it is you’re jonesing for. go for it. for real, what would it look like if you stopped dreaming and started doing? if you showed up ready to do the messy, necessary work. you don’t have to know every detail of the how; you simply have to trust that the universe has got your back and that maybe, juuust maybe, you deserve to break out of the ho hum grind and just freaking go for it. okay, i did it for you. active income comes as a direct result of our efforts. it’s what i frequently refer to as “trading hours for dollars.” there are ways to make stellar and significant active income becoming a ceo, doctor, play professional sports, etc but the thing about active income is that you always have to show up in order to get paid. residual income refers to the money you continue to make after your work is done. in direct sales, a consultant may work to earn the business of customer a, but the consultant will continue to get paid every time customer a makes a future purchase. the myth about residual income is that you can then just kick back and never work ever again. not true. but it does allow you the freedom and flexibility to continue to build and live life on your terms in the meantime “you think you know, but you have no idea. this is the diary of a direct sales chick.”⁣ anyone else remember mtv from the early 2000s? stop acting like you’re a psl. no one is trying to “get you,” jan.⁣ do conmen and women exist? of course. are there bad opportunity out there? yep.⁣ is direct sales typically where you find either of those? nope.⁣ sister, you have to reframe how you think about direct sales. it’s not about “us” trying to “get” you. think about it: this is an opportunity that can be molded to serve you for whatever you need it to.⁣ grocery money?⁣ a vacation fund?⁣ amazon prime?⁣ a plan b?⁣ replacing a part time job?⁣ that is why so many people sing about their side gigs from the virtual rooftops. it’s done something for them. and maybe, it can do something for

in the workplace report conducted by mckinsey and sheryl sandberg’s leanin.org, working mothers are three times more likely to bear the brunt of the workplace home changes and stressors due to this pandemic than fathers. shoutout to all the women out there working their full time jobs and a side hustle, and we’re cheering on any woman who realizes you can have your professional cake and enjoy your family life, too... it just might look like knocking over the corporate ladder and setting a entrepreneurial table for likeminded women. let’s debunk our grandparent’s belief that we shouldn’t talk about money or that it’s “unladylike” to want it. money is energy, and ya need it to live. it’s 2020, and with so many ways to make extra money in addition to your “career” job, i don’t know many people who aren’t thinking of some kind of side gig; but if you’re smart, that extra income is coming from a direct sales business. why? the earning potential is uncapped, you’re not trading hours for dollars, and the business can be run wherever you have wifi. seems like a no-brainer to me crazy shit happens across the board on the last day of the month. goals are crushed, sales are closed, and people show up in their businesses. so what would it look like for you if you showed up consistently with that drive, intentionality and intensity every day? as you make your october goals, i’m giving you a friendly nudge to go in full speed. you’re capable. you’re worth it. and it’s time to step up to your next level. who’s in?!⁣ happy month end to all you hustlers out there!! i’m just like you running a direct sales gig and running for goals today! back to regularly scheduled content tomorrow!! how can i cheer you on?! what are you or you and your team running for today?! do the reach outs. ask.⁣ follow up.⁣ know you’re worthy of success. ask anyone who’s ever been successful at direct sales. i can almost guarantee that every single one of us were scared shitless before taking the first step. what will my friends and family think?⁣ what will my colleagues think?⁣ what if i fail?⁣ what if i embarrass myself?⁣ what if i don’t know the answer about a product? what if i’m not ready?⁣ the “what if” and worst case scenario list is virtually endless. we all had some version of it before we took the call, asked the questions, and ultimately decided to go for it. so yeah, maybe the woman you see today on social media is living her best life but trust me, at some point, she was scared to start; but she took action anyway. take action, sis. start living on the other side of “yes.” if you’re curious about what that direct sales chick does, freaking ask her. she’s not going to ask you for your first born child or a dna swab or ask you to marry her. she’ll answer your questions so you can find out if this is the right opportunity for you. because how pissed will you be when someone else in your network who’s just as smart and successful and well-connected as you asks first...and she earns everything that’s available to you right now? one of the reasons our industry can get such a bad rap is because once someone joins a direct sales company, they turn into weird robots who’s seen the drill susie q joins a company and right off the bat, she’s coached to emulate her up, up, upline who’s made millions of dollars and now runs an evangelical church and orphanage in a third world county. while that’s lovely...it’s not susie q. one of the most detrimental things i see happen is when women try to pull this weird chameleon stunt and it never, ever, ever works. sis, if she ain’t the best version of you, don’t emulate her. yes, successful people have obviously done something right along the way, but the most powerful thing you can do in this business is be yourself.⁣ if you swear like a sailor, keep at it. if you’ve always woven bible versus into your social media, amen. if you have always had strong opinions, keep ‘em! if you don’t know wtf a “flat lay” or a preset is, don’t change! if you would never say “hey, dollface!” to someone in real life, don’t fucking say it in a reach out just because that’s what some chick in your upline does. it doesn’t matter if something worked for someone else. if you lose your authenticity in hopes of gaining approval, likes, and sales...it’s never gonna click. ⁣just be yourself can we stop normalizing hating our jobs?⁣ because 80 of workers do⁣⁣ you spend 13 of your life at work. that’s 90,000 hours over the course of a lifetime. add insult to injury? the average american also spends 100 simply commuting. if you’re not doing what you love, it’s time to wake up and figure out a plan of action to get you there. hear me: direct sales does not have to be your passion! nor does your goal in life need to include having your direct sales business be your cash cow. but, sis, it is a way to make an income that allows your more time and flexibility to work on the things that fires you up. and i don’t care who you are or what you do i don’t know anyone who doesn’t want more time and financial flexibility. ⁣⁣source: medium class is in session! creating your ideal life and ideal career takes so many tools, choices large and small, and multiple streams of income. the hustle don’t stop on the weekend, sis. choosing to become is hard, but staying exactly the same is hard and terrifying. what are you working on this weekend, my friends?! don’t look down on someone from your desk or cubicle, sis. your job could quit you in a minute. would you find another job? of course.⁣ but would you have the additional income to fill the gaps in the meantime? i don’t say this to fear monger or sound pessimistic but it’s insane if you’re walking around with all your eggs in plan a’s basket. easter bunny that shit. put eggs everywhere. consider these numbers next time someone says it’s “too expensive” to start a side gig, or if they ask you “why do i have to pay anything to start? that doesn’t make sense!” direct sales requires a minimal start up cost for the business kit. companies that are members of the dsa offer 90 buyback, too. becoming a realtor requires you to pay for licensing testing, training, marketing materials, membership fees, and state costs. there is also zero refund on that investment. oh, and be prepared to give up all your weekends considering becoming a uber or lyft driver? well, you need to cover costs of a car auto loan or lease, maintenance, insurance, gas, there’s no refund on depreciation...and yep, you’re trading hours for dollars want to franchise a restaurant? okay, daddy warbucks! you need upwards of $500k $1m to cover franchise licensing, rentpurchase of location, city licensing, paying employees. that’s a ton of risk for zero refund on investment if things don’t work out. and restaurant hours? direct sales is smart. it’s the future. there is little to no risk, yet the opportunity to make the income you desire is great. sounds pretty sweet if you ask me source: direct selling association wake up, sister. it’s time for an upgrade. and who do you trust more than your friends? no one!⁣ direct sales isn’t goin’ anywhere, sis. we’ve

attitudes and entrepreneurship study fact: 50 of people who enroll in any direct sales company quit within 14 days if they don’t make their first sale which is fine. nothing against those people, but guess what? those same people who make zero dollars because they quit are absolutely included in any company’s income disclosure statement. it’s not the industry that “screwed” them; they stopped trying when they met their first ant hill of a speed bump. so when you read that “an average consultant makes $300 a year” you have to consider how many “two weekers” bring down the average. instead, you should talk to someone in the industry who makes a paycheck, and ask for the average income of their team or their power partners. people who are actively putting in effort. the response might make you do a much needed double take. source: direct selling news⁣ oh also, pyramid schemes are illegal, so it can actually come off as both rude and ignorant when someone asks if what we do is a scheme. the structure of a direct sales organization is shaped like a pyramid, yes. great news, so is every organization. it’s not unique to network marketing. what’s different for the network marketing professional is that our hard work, consistency, and dedication is directly correlated to where we find ourselves in said pyramid-shaped organization. this is unlike our corporate jobs. for example, there is one ceo at the top who makes the most money. no matter how hard we each work at our day jobs, no matter how consistent we are, no matter how many metrics we crush, only one of us

to make anyone comfortable. you’re here to play big, okay?⁣ ladies and gentlemen, the opportunity exists for you to create your own raise outside of your 9-5. want an extra $12,000year? or more? stop being silly and reach out to that chick you keep watching who’s killing it in the direct sales channel. she’ll show you exactly what to do. ig story views don’t lie for whatever reason, we’ve been led to believe that it’s reasonable to trade one hour of our time for $7.25...⁣ ...but starting a direct sales side hustle that you can run from your phone, on your own time, with an unlimited income potential is “risky.” i don’t know about you, but that shit doesn’t make sense. know your worth and act accordingly. but like for real i know what i’m focusing on, wbu? tag other winning babes who need this reminder! can’t talk outta both sides of your mouth, sis. let’s all lift each other up, mmmkay? peace out, cheap seats choose wisely, girlfriend. i’ve talked to so many people who would rather be broke and unable to afford the things they want and need in life than put themselves out there and try something new. ladies, that doesn’t make sense! everyone has to start somewhere. just freaking go for it, mmmkay?!⁣ stop worrying about who might judge you, and start considering who might be inspired by your badassery. for fuck’s sake, ladies. start owning your shit. i can’t tell you how many times i hear women in direct sales say “well, it’s not, like, sales”⁣⁣ yes it is. social sharing is sales, it’s awesome, and so are you! karma is a bitch i can support you okay, jan? where my boss babes at?! tell me your money makin’ goals so i can cheer you on!⁣ truth we all do it. the smartest ones get paid to do it. anyone else glad we’re not in hs anymore? being nervous doesn’t mean it’s a “sign” you shouldn’t be doing something. being “nervous” is your brain’s way of telling you that you’re about to embark on something new. you get to decide if you’re going to be a badass or let fear win. simple as that stop saying “pyramid” like it’s a bad word. that’s literally the shape of most organizations. more people at the bottom, less people at the top. the great thing about direct sales, though, is that depending on how hard and how smart! you work, you’re in control of where you sit in said pyramid. get it, girl. quitting: the only real way to fail in keep going, sis great morning my beautiful healthy familia march 1, 2020 this day will never come again. no matter how you woke up feeling today, know you are an extraordinary human you are loved life is one big lesson

peel off the layers you have been pushing aside out of fear. confront them, understand why what has happened what you can do today about it. release it all with love align your life. take care of the vessel you were given, as it will take care of you for the rest of your life. let go of anything or anyone that doesn’t serve you. discover all the beautiful things that bring you joy. learn to love you then teach the world how to do the same pic cred @aymeep.s.boudoir no, it’s not the very beginning of the new year [which is typically when yearly reflection takes place] but i truly felt this year i needed to take my time and reflect on some things i’ve learned over the past year. crap happens in life and it’s up to us to make the best of it. i think this has been a huge part of my life and other people’s lives and i’ve had to really work through my honest thoughts about it. when crap happens to us over and over again it is exhausting [physically and mentally]. sure, most of us bounce back after one tough or unwanted situation but when things keep happening one after another [that you either didn’t plan for, don’t like or just can’t really get out of] it’s just flat out exhausting. but the simplest and [not easy] truth is that regardless of the crap that happens to us, we have to keep on fighting. we can't let one situation get to us. i absolutely believe we should take the time to be human [cry, scream, or throw something]. but then pick ourselves up, be positive and make the best of it because the truth is. it may still be awful, sad or hard but who we become because of it is priceless. shoutout someone who bounces back and stays positive during the crap. mood what’s your favorite color happy i am feeling so happy refreshed today. i needed a break from the city life. we did our reset ritual this am we journaled we prayed we did yoga by the pool. i’m soaking up so much inspiration from the other boss babes here. i can’t stress how important it is to be around other people with vision, especially if you’re trying to level up!!

focussing on our inner self or “capital s self” is hard work! i would say most people depending on personality type avoid this type of work altogether. it’s deep man- extremely revealing. i just know for me, i reached a point where i was fed up i know i want more for my life to find a greater purpose. it's a girl we are so excited to finally share that our sweet little blessing is a girl! we are naming her paisley grace simonsen. our anatomy scan went very well today. we were able to see everything except one thing with the kidneys [due to her positioning], so we will complete the anatomy scan at my following appointment in 4 weeks. she is measuring almost a week ahead of schedule [13 ounces], we got to see her yawn and make a fist, she loves to be curled up with her hands and feet next to her head and her heartbeat is 144. mama has gained 5 pounds and blood pressure is perfect. it was fun to see her move on the ultrasound and feel bubbles associated with her movement. although i cannot feel her moving much, my ob said with the positioning of the placenta and me being lean, i likely won't feel her movements more until about 24 weeks. we love you, babygirl!

like so many of you, i've just been trying to stay afloat myself! i've taken some time for myself to adjust and figure out what working from home full-time looks like for me during this time. how do i continue doing the work that i absolutely love in a time of uncertainty? is it wrong to remind people that i'm still open for business? i just wasn't sure. but then i read something from a friend that completely shifted my entire perspective: you might know people who, at this very minute, are on their knees praying for a plan b. so when i look at it that way, it almost feels selfish to not remind you that i might be able to help you. with that being said, i'm going to continue to try to navigate my business in a way that is sensitive, respectful, and above all, grounded in the best intentions. and that means i'm here to help you explore a plan b [if you might need it] and share life-changing skincare [if you might needwant self-love]! most days via ig my life looks really perfect. a lot of people you follow on ig prob seem like they are flawless right? this morning while meditating i felt like there was a fist in my solar plexus, pressure in my chest, a lump in my throat. hello, anxiety. i feel you. what an interesting thing it is to come into alignment with yourself be able to feel your feels. in order to do what i do guide others to healthier, more conscious living, i must do lots of personal growth work behind the scenes. the stuff you guys don’t see: crying, anxiety, fear, conflict, daily challenges to overcome, more crying, sometimes yelling, rejection, more anxiety, more fear. why on earth am i sharing this with you right now? oh- it’s because i want you to know that i’m a soul in a body having human experiences everyday... just like you. what do i do when i’m experiencing those things that we might label as “negative” or “bad”? i’m learning to go inward. focusing more time energy on getting to know understand myself is my current mission. when i come back to this space, i always feel better am able to sort out whatever is going on in my head. faith over fear! i’d love to hear how you guys resonate with this, if you do. what things are you doing daily to practice self care or to find introspection? share in the comments below! great morning my beautiful healthy familia woke up soooo thankful for you @iamedensoto everything is so much clearer. so much brighter i know in my heart have i told you lately, how proud i am of you!!!

staying angry? it’s hurts you more than the person that you’re angry with? every time you give your mind to something unproductive you’re stealing time away that could be used to help you work towards a goal you have. or simply to enjoy the moments you’re in. don't slow yourself down by holding grudges. don't steal your own time. let it go. focus your energy on things that will move you forward. what are you holding onto that you need to let go? what is stealing your time? what grudges are you latched onto? i challenge you to let them go. why do i do what i do you ask well, i have a virtual wellness business because i’m on a mission to help men women flourish and feel empowered, but also... i have a vision to open a yoga studio, host retreats, have my own fitness yoga app, sit on boards for organizations i care about support dance the arts, be a present mother wife some day, travel help others find freedom choices in their lives. sooooo when i take a look at my core values my dreams being in charge of my time running my own business makes the most sense serves as a vehicle for me to make moves!! blessed beyond measure by this opportunity. top @allgoodfeels shoes @louboutinworld anyone else have cinnamon rolls every saturday morning in the 80s??? peace out la. i’m off to the west side. this is sort of a joke, but not totally. i grew up in mi by the water lately the water has been calling me. my craves the ocean vibes. i’m apparently entering my in one week i’ll enter the last year of my 20’s. i think it’s time for some life shifts. this. made. my. day. i finally got to spend some time with my mama and on mother's day! just what this girl needed! love you, mama! from my loud house to yours happy mother's day!!!! i hope you all enjoy your day! life is not about being perfect, and i also believe it’s not about balance either. balance implies that things are even. the truth is, what we do think most days is what makes up who we are. a donut here or there won’t sabotage your healthy living journey, but donuts 50 or more of the time sure could!! i believe this same concept about business. life isn’t about finding balance- to me, it’s about finding what’s important to you, creating values, and then living in that space most of the time, while still enjoying the other spaces some of the time. make sense? some food for thought this monday... no pun intended. if i haven't thanked you enough already for everything, i'd like to say it again—thank you. as i sit here with my feet kicked up, on this peaceful, rainy morning, i can barely contain the waves of happiness i have for being your wife. thank you for letting me sleep a little longer, regardless of how much you need to rest, too. thank you for being my best friend and confidant. you are my rock, and i don't know what i'd do without you. thank you for putting us—your girls—first. my forever snuggle buddy! this girl is such a lover! and wants all the attention! yep, тнaт'ѕ wнaт ι call ιт pop pop fizz fizz i’ve never liked it until now now, you have won me over вυвℓу ριиєαρρℓє ℓα¢яσιχ нιвιѕ¢υѕ ℓα¢яσιχ ℓιмσи ¢єℓℓσ ℓα¢яσιχ ωαтєямєℓσи hope this brings a smile to your face. it’s going to be a fantastic day!!! the boys call this the wednesday morning donut dance i do not own the rights to this music 29 weeks 11 weeks to go drink, eat, pee [and pee and pee and peeeeeee times] and try to sleep! repeat! love feeling all of p's movements and watching this bump grow! she loves cuddling right on top of sister, paisley! it's so stinking cute but so darn uncomfortable! greasy, oily mess???

because i was so embarrassed by my adult acne. if you are anything like i used to be, you know just how important it is when you feel so confident in yourself and your skin, that you can leave the house makeup free. that was my goal and i definitely achieved that through using the right skincare with rf. if you are reading this and have any skin concerns or you just want to be rid of that tired and dull look then i would love to be the one to help you achieve it. your face is the first thing that people see. i have found, as i’m getting older [into my 30’s gasssppp, i know], how important it is to take care of your body and skin and it should be a top priority. you wear your face for the rest of your life. i know how much this priority shift has changed the skin game for me. message me your questions or comment below and i'd love to give you my recommendations. i wish i could bottle up his excitement and joy we got married 10 years ago today. are you feeling stuck with what to get the man in your life for father’s day today and tomorrow you can snag 3 products for only $25. there are 3 sets to choose from. i’m super excited about replenishing ken’s shampoo while getting the shave cream for myself for both of us with these bundles you are saving up to 76 off retail and i’m all about a good deal dm me for your order 32 weeks 8 weeks to due date i have definitely started noticing awake and sleep patterns with this little lady. i absolutely love when she is awake and moving around [it's nonstop]. doctor's appointment went well this afternoon. blood pressure was great. weight gain is great. rechecked throid with a blood draw. sweet p is still measuring a week ahead. i wouldn’t say that this was an epic fail....but honestly, i’m not loving it i didn’t feel like drying my hair after my shower last night so i thought i’d try something different. i’ve seen lots of people braid their hair when wet and then have gorgeous curls after it dried. one big problem is probably that i haven’t braided my own hair since middle school; y’all that was a long time ago my hair feels amazing, but i’m not loving the curl pattern. have you ever tried something and it didn’t go as planned? do you have any suggestions for the next time i try this, because i will try it again for sure!! i love naps. any chance i get to nap with this little guy, i do i’ve always loved naps. i remember in college, i’d go home between classes and take a power nap. jump back up and head to class. remember that @katmcoley16 @anancemanning @minzaina i was also really sick during that time with my but kept pushing along day after day like i wasn’t sick. it’s amazing to me how our bodies try so hard to tell our brains what we need, if we’d only listen. since my surgery i’ve tried to listen to my body more. that means when i’m tired, i stop and i rest. i have to do less intense workouts than i want to, go to bed earlier, etc. the list goes on, but the important part is that i’m learning to finally listen to my body. what do you do to rest and recharge your body? i’m always looking for new things to try something big just happened in the machesky house!!!! check out my stories to see what it is how often do you make up stories in your head? the what ifs that narrate our life? well, i have a new what if for you. what if the narration you tell yourself, the dialogue, the story. .what if you told yourself a positive story instead? so many times our brain automatically goes to the negative, we tell ourselves the worst case scenario will happen and then allow that fear to paralyze us, make us sad and mad and even hurt. but what if we flip the script? what if we make a conscious decision to narrate a positive response. can you imagine how much happier we would be? it isn’t being naive, it is altering your mindset. there is so much research out there that proves that we are what is in our mind, that what we choose to focus on is our reality. i don’t need to focus on what could happen in a negative attitude but focus on what if something good happened instead. this pretty lady is a freakin rock star!! not only is she an amazing fiancé to her man and proud momma of 5, she is killing it in her biz!!!! i’m amazed at her strength and determination to set a goal and crush it she is helping so many women and men change their lives for the better through her business. she is a leader. she is a friend. she is a teacher. she is a business owner. she is @danireynolds81 supported a black business today! go check them out! the whole family loved our sunday treats!!! if i was at my previous job, i would have missed this moment this is of the many reasons i chose the network marketing field... i had no idea what i was doing or what i was getting into. i just knew it was big. what are you missing out on my friend? good tuesday morning!! i’m getting my hair colored and trimmed thursday i am so excited!! last time i had my hair colored was february 19 i’d say it’s lasted a good loooong while! i’ve decided to tame the color a bit and lighten up for the summer. all 3 of these are similar but help me decide which one to go with. there’s 1 i’m definitely leaning towards. which picture do you guys like the best? appreciation post this guy! i cannot express enough just how hardworking this husband of mine is! his crew has worked 18 hours every day since sunday morning! i'm so proud to be the wife of a 3rd generation lineman! stay safe out there baby! your girls are so proud of you we love you more than anything! sign of a successful play date...zonked out kiddos how i feel about studios starting to re-open!! all of my fellow dance teachers fitness professionals- i know you feel me on this!! most of my life since i was 6 has been spent in a studio or a gym so this time has been especially challenging. i will never take those sacred spaces our ability to come together move for granted ever again!! dance fitness studios are special places because they bring all different kinds of people together. i’ve made friends taught students that i would have never met otherwise. @allgoodfeels @louboutinworld a little throwback thursday for ya have you ever thought back on your ambitions and goals back in the day and what drives you now? honestly, i think my goals and my “why” are constantly changing and evolving. i started my business to make a few extra bucks to help support my tj maxx addiction...can anyone relate?? my why has grown into simply wanting to help others. helping others feel more confident, attractive, successful, accomplished. your possibilities are endless in this business. what drives you? today was supposed to be my last day nannying this sweet girl. actually, it would have been my last official day nannying, at all. these posts are always hard for me to write because i get so attached to my kiddos. what a year and a half it was with little molly! being a nanny, you often spend more time during the day with the kids than the parents! and so in that time together you become attached and they become part of who you are and what makes you, you! we had some difficult days with tears, bumps and bruises [who doesn't] but for the most part our days were all giggles, smiles and fun! going through all of the pictures i had of molly on my phone was tough but this one made me tear up. it made me miss her even more than i have these last several months of not being able to finish out my time as her nanny and having it all end so abruptly. i will miss my conversations with her parents every morning, their pure kindness towards me and allowing me to be an extended member of their family. and even though molly won't remember our time together, she will always have a special place in my heart. it's not goodbye, it's see you later! love you, mol. when you set a goal and put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything. today easton passed his swim test at our pool, swimming the length of the pool unassisted!! excited is an understatement whether your goal is swimming the length of the pool, earning extra income for your family, or climbing the highest mountain you can find, the gratification of achieving that goal can be more rewarding than you initially imagined. your only limit is your mind. the school year is officially over!! what a crazy school year for sure!! bring on summertime this is lake life. happy sunday!!! sometimes you need to take some time and relax and reset for the week!! it’s monday. this is my office view. this has fueled me for over two and a half years! through normal life and two pregnancies! i will fill my cup everyday because this total nutrition is simply the best! good morning! quick morning yoga shoot at @stompinggroundla now off to michigan for some family time!! thanks @vuoriclothing for the dope gear- these leggings are eight years ago today, this man walked into my life today we take our maternity pictures for our sweet little blessing, paisley! i tried it again and i’m liking this result a lot better! maybe one day i’ll learn how to french braid my own hair but for the time being i started with @jaimebryant928 suggestion did the french twist instead. after washing my hair i used our air dry cream gel mixed together. thanks @geminimama617 for that styling tip! applied the combo to my damp hair attempted the when my hair dried this is the wave i had i’m loving it! easy peasy i took a break from the this will definitely be on repeat throughout the summer! if you have been watching my business over the past almost four years and ever thought to yourself “good for her, but i couldn’t do that because. i don’t have the time. i don’t have the money. i don’t want to be that girl. i don’t want to annoy people. i don’t know if anyone who would even want to support my business. i am definitely not a salesperson. i. said. it. all. only difference?

we want our kids with us...we just need some alone time i for one think it’s finding a healthy balance i’m very thankful to have chosen an occupation that helps me pay for day camps like this. it’s important for the kids to enjoy some time away from parents and it’s good for parents to have some time for themselves as well. i find that after a day separated from my kiddos i hug them a little longer, talk a little sweeter, and linger in their conversations instead of rushing to the next task at hand. i’m going to enjoy the alone time i have and enjoy giving them big squeezes when i pick them up ᔕᑌᗰᗰeᖇ ᕼᗩiᖇ...ᗪoᑎ't ᑕᗩᖇe sun and heat can do a number on your hair. after years of beach going and pool swimming i’ve come up a few things that really help protect my hair during this time of year. here are my top 6 tips for protecting your hair this summer. wear a hat—baseball or wide brim hat. either will do a great job at shielding your hair face from the damaging rays of the sun. check out the chlorine—if you’ll be in a chlorine pool, it’s best to wet your hair before going for a swim. this will help your hair absorb less of the chlorine. clarify condition—use a gentle clarifying shampoo that won’t strip your hair of essential nutrients it needs. i recommend monat’s clarifying shampoo. make sure to condition your hair well. the sun’s rays can be drying. try monat’s restore leave in conditioner. alternate up dos—alternate how you are putting your hair up. always pulling your hair up in the exact same place adds extra stress to your tresses. use products with uv absorbers—i suggest using monat’s restore leave in conditioner or color locking protective spray. both contain crodasorb which is a uv absorber protects hair from sun damage. overnight oil treatments—once a week use rejuvenique oil as an overnight treatment to restore moisture, shine, manageability. welcome to my world! my house is loud af! three kids, crazy husband then theirs me! lol everyday i try hard to make sometime for me to work on my physical and mental! i feel like i can do it all! i'm glad i get to journey down this road again! far from perfect but always striving for perfection! join me! 35 weeks my waddle game is strong this mama got her hair cut and colored [see shae seiber bello haven salon in johnstown she's awesome]. we had maternity pictures last night [denice webb photography she's so much fun]. we start weekly appointments next week. cannot believe we are 35 days away from our due date. those of you who know me well, know i like to be busy! my whole life i have filled my schedule. i get so excited about all of the projects i’m working on all of the opportunities that come my way. one of the best life skills i learned recently was how to say “no”. i know many of you can relate!! what i’ve learned is i’m able to show up fully for things that are really important to me when i say no to the things that aren’t serving where i’m going or the things that drain me. people often ask me what i do for fun because i appear to constantly be on the grind. although i work hard spend a lot of time on growing my businesses, i also have been committing more time to having fun relaxing without feeling guilty about it. i almost have to force myself to do this, but i know it’s important because if i don’t recharge, at some point sooner than later i’ll burn out. so for those of you who ask me what i do for fun- this one’s for you!! and for those of you on the grind all the time- what would happen if we trusted that our businesses lives can flourish even if we take a day off to take care of ourselves? i need your opinion...what should we do with this storage area? it’s located off our master bathroom. we’d like to finish the space but besides walls and tile, what else should we do to make the space usable? if you could wave a magic wand change one thing about your skin or health, what would it be?? i’ll tell you mine- i wanted to have clear skin i was proud to wear out everyday i wanted to feel energized nourished after i ate, rather than sluggish bloated. reaching our optimal health is an ongoing journey that’s sometimes challenging. i’m so happy to share some tips tools with you that have boosted my confidence changed the way i experience life!! 1. eat whole-foods from the earth! 2. drink lots of water! 3. sleep! 4. use clean skincare cosmetics you’re not just what you eat, you’re also what you absorb! need more help or some accountability??

did it make you feel selfish? i needed monat. i needed a break from mom life. i needed to make my own money. i needed it for my confidence. i needed to be able to help others. i needed something more. i’m just being honest. i don’t think i was selfish to finally figure this out. i think it makes me a better mom wife because i know what i need. and i do it unapologetically. i feel this so important especially for us mommas! we have to fill up or cup in order to pour into others and our families! super grateful for this time! during the workout my not look like it but i've falling in love with putting in the work! let's all get in the best shape... being your own boss sure has its perks! i love how i can listen to my friends and mentors inspire me on a mini road trip [talk about some personal development], have lunch with my family, snuggle with my girls and work my business [in small pockets of time around all of this]. thanks, boss lady! [that's me, i'm the boss]! you don’t meet people by accident. there’s always a reason, a lesson, or a blessing. whatever the reason, we are learning from each other i consider her a huge blessing. so thankful for you @kellydicap sometimes we have to do things we don’t want to do. sometimes we have to grind. sometimes we have to hustle. sometimes we have to live a way we don’t want to for a short period of time, in order to have long-term gain. during that time, we ask ourselves over over “is this even worth it?” or “what am i even doing?!” i’m positive when we ride the wave stay in it, we end up being so glad we stuck it out! whatever your goals are, tell yourself i am worth it. i deserve this! i am wildly capable. i am full of unpredictable growth. my life is abundant full! seriously, if you don’t believe it, no one else will for you!! i see people give up all the time right before they could have hit the jackpot on their hard earned success. all. the. time. stick with it as my friend mentor @zoekinnee says- “work until”!! confidence. it’s not something i’ve always had. i receive an email everyday from lauren at the i am journal @theiamjournal everyday there is a positive affirmation. one recently stated “i am capable of this.” we are capable of so much more! believe in yourself. be unstoppable!! be confident in all that you do of my best friends are the ones with paws! why is change so hard?

[thanks heartburn, it was worth it]. i shared this today on a fun lunch time chat with @lacontemporarydance summer intensive students, and i want to share it here with you guys too. when i moved to la in 2013, i looked a lot different. not just physically, but my insides were a lot different too.️ i came to la only identifying as a dancer. i spent years trying to fit into a space i didn’t truly fit into. i was being inauthentic. i cried a lot, was confused depressed, wasn’t happy with my body, wasn’t happy with my life, had no idea what i was doing. sure- i had a few highlights to my career, but mostly they’d be followed by confusion sadness all over again. i had this vision that i had to book certain jobs, be like certain people in the industry, look a certain way, and have a certain type of headshot in order to be legit for other people to see me as a dancer too. i was suffering from imposter syndrome hard. i’ve spent the last few years becoming unrecognizable to my past self. re-discovering, in a way remembering, who i really am. i am not perfect, nor have i “arrived”. but every day i’m learning to love myself more- assuring myself i am worthy of my own time attention. i focus every day on how to feel better from the inside out i ask myself how i can take advantage of opportunities to help serve my communities whether that’s thru dance, fitness, or health wellness. my work in the fitness industry helps me be a better dance teacher. my dance background helps me be a better yoga teacher. my clean eating personal wellness experiences have helped me know how to guide others in both of these spaces while also helping myself live more abundantly. it’s amazing how when we open our eyes release the “tunnel vision” how much god and the universe can bring to us. grateful is a huge understatement. i’m on today am so happy to be able to share my story journey with others. craziest part to me is- this just still feels like the beginning!! who would have ever thought some schools would be starting the school year off virtually because of a global pandemic?!? things have changed so much in the past few months. going to school, socializing, shopping, working, all look different, and we are having to adapt to our new normal. it’s stressful. lots of tough decision are being made daily. maybe you have no clue how you are going to balance your job and schooling your kiddos. maybe you’ve chosen to go with a home school approach instead. maybe you’ve decided that your child would do best in private school. i applaud whatever it is that you have decided to do because you know your child and your family dynamics best. if you’ve made a decision but you’re just not sure how it’s going to work... you need extra money to pay for private school you need a more flexible job option for your family you need a plan b because your plan a isn’t looking so good now let’s chat. let’s have a coffee zoom or happy hour zoom. i’m here to listen and assist in figuring out if this business would be a good fit for you and your family’s needs. happy 4th birthday, jaylynn nycol! we love you so much! enjoy your special day! instagram vs. real life!! miss paisley had her first doctor's appointment and outing today. she is a healthy, growing girl. she referred her hearing test on the left side [while in the hospital] so we will retest that on the 29th but otherwise she has gained weight since we left the hospital, is breastfeeding so well [milk came in this morning] and checked out perfectly with her pediatrician. we are just so over the moon in love with this little girl. at the wral soccer fields today...this place is huuugggeee!!! i was able to work from the soccer fields today while watching my kiddos. you don’t have to give up caring for your kids in order to do this successfully. you don’t have to give up your 9-5 job in order to do this successfully. you don’t have to feel run down at the end of your day. i can help you figure out how to weave working your biz into your everyday life. i want you to know there are options out there, and i happen to know of a great one “but seriously, how is your business different from all these others” well i’m so glad you asked!! we offer a consumable product...you literally use it, experience improved hair skin, wash it down the drain, and repeat. you are building residual income. you do the same thing with big box brands but by purchasing from someone like me, a small business owner, you’re helping someone you know personally. i’m not changing anyone’s habits. we all wash our hair and our face. simply give me your shampoo conditioner or skincare and i’ll give you mine. you will see a difference. if you’re interested in all the other ways my company is different from others, let’s chat. i haven’t even touched on our amazing, attainable free trips our amazing car program!! dm me...let’s set up a time to chat happy birthday to the best dada and husband! you got the best gift right there in your arms! enjoy all the snuggles with your girls today! we love you more than anything! i love to challenge my body physically. i think when we challenge our body compete against ourself, it creates a stronger mind for doing other things as well... like growing a business or building self confidence or dealing with life challenges. that mind body connection is so important! if you’ve been skipping it- i encourage you to jump back in slowly then work your way up to a challenging space that’s maybe even a little out of your comfort zone. i believe that doing something physically we didn’t think we could do builds that belief and inner confidence that we strive for. check out my yoga subscription: @spacemvmtco and enjoy my free hiit workouts! new class posted every week for you to train learn from the comfort safety of your own home. taking care of myself doesn’t mean “me first” it means “me too” l.r. knosts recharging with my favorite face scrub made with crushed cranberry seeds. hoping for an early bedtime too how do you relax recharge? @hairbyjaymy these two ladies did the most important thing they could when they first committed to a challenge, and that's finish! sometimes you beast it and others you barely cross the finish line but you cross! our next 21 day challenge starts august 1st! join us! everyone always says yes to me!! -said no one ever! the difference between success failure is that the people i know who have experienced great success simply failed more times, fell down more times, faced more rejection than the people who gave up. how does that work? well, giving up is easy, and people who are in it to win it get back up!! life is hard! the way we face challenge our ability to take rejection head on to get back up to try again again will be the deciding factor in our success. the entertainers, business owners, athletes, coaches, fitness professionals, choreographers that i know that experience extreme success have simply fallen down gotten back up more times than those who failed due to throwing in the towel prematurely. 1 week old i am not sure how our little lady is already a week old but she is. oh, be still my heart. we love you, paisley grace. girl- you are beautiful, strong, powerful, incredible!! as women we should be here to support and uplift one another. i’m beyond grateful for the dope women i have in my life. thanks @livewellwithkristine @kerrilauter for nominating me. why are these available now??

so here i am. 10:30pm. post vegan food, dessert, a hard kombucha... epsom salt bath untamed by @glennondoyle 2 weeks old [yesterday] at our 2 week check up today, the little lady weighed in at 7 pounds 7.5 ounces. first round of blood work screening came back normal and she had her heel pricked for round two today. doctor was impressed with her weight gain and said she doesn't need to be woke up to feed at night anymore. highlights so far: found her thumb alert wide eyed hates being naked loves to eat w mama favorite spot is on dada's chest you know what they say about the grass. what you water, that’s what grows. our reesey girl is in heat! poor girl is not a fan! spayed appointment will be in our future soon! we let her go through one heat cycle because we were hoping her hormones would help her with her hopping and it has! she is walking much more than hopping these days! theme of the week: being patient with my body loving myself from the inside, out. i’m learning that happiness doesn’t come from anyone or anything else. all of the outside circumstances could be aligning the doubt, anxiety, depression, and fear can still creep in. finding my inner calm checking in constantly with my inner dialogue is key right now. wanna get bomb ass hair???? i just happen to know of a killer deal...6 full sized products, 1 travel size product, and a free gift. around $110 before tax. new customer $130 a free 4 oz product. deal ends tomorrow. i’d say that should last you til christmas or 2021 even if you wash everyday...does it sound like a lot of money now??? and then there is miss abby! our little chunky monkey, who hides in the laundry room to sleep throughout the day! hair is dirty, but sweat suit, nails, matcha latte are right. our birthing story saturday, july 18th i was having what i thought were braxton hicks contractions starting around 11am. we worked on the bathroom all day and ran back and forth to lowe's, grabbed 5 guys for a late dinner and showered. those contractions turned into the real deal about 9pm and i waited for them to be about every 5 minutes, 1 minute apart for an hour [like they told me for weeks leading up to this day]. we called the birth center and the ob on call told me to try and labor at home as long as possible and to try and sleep [since this was my first baby she said i would likely get sent home after a few hours to labor at home anyway. but she gave me directions on coming in if things progressed]. and that they did. my contractions just kept intensifying. finally i just had to sit in the bathroom because i felt like i just needed to have a bowel movement and that's when my water broke at home at 11:50pm. we left the house at 11:59pm and made it to the hospital at 12:09am on the 19th. when we arrived i was dilated to a 10 already and they moved quickly to get me admitted. when the ob walked in, i told her well, i labored at home like you said. and she just laughed. i ended up pushing for about 45 minutes with no epidural. my husband was the real vip for getting us to the birth center so quickly [didn't want to deliver in the car], keeping me calm, encouraging me to push and fanning me to keep my cool because i felt like i was on fire. my nurses, the ob and the resident who delivered paisley were amazing and coached me through everything perfectly [including breastfeeding]. so we did a thing today...little guy’s first time riding a horse it’s been 20 years for me. he was in heaven!!! he loved it all...from brushing, to riding, to feeding, to scooping poop! biggest smiles ever from this kiddo. big thanks to our amazing friends @jadyconboy for a fun filled, amazing afternoon evening. can’t wait to do it again!! if we don’t get something it’s because we either didn’t seriously want it or we tried to bargain on the price aka buy a cheap seat or use the fast pass. there have been some things recently that did not work out or happen for me. i have my occasional pitty party literally cried on the kitchen floor last night my boyfriend threatened to take a video post on social and then after the pitty party is over i’m like okay, let’s dive deeper into why this isn’t happening yet. am i too attached? am i clinging? do i believe i am deserving or that it is possible for me?? have i done the work or am i wishing hoping to just cut in line? hope waiting for something to happen. hunger finding a way to make it happen. as john maxwell says, “people with hope are many; people with hunger are few”. which are you?? august 7, 2019. a day that forever changed my life. a day i will never forget. i thought i was just having another colonoscopy to see yet again there was still inflammation and we’d need to again try a different medication. i was not prepared for what would happen next. i was not prepared to have surgery. definitely not prepared to lose an organ and gain a bag. i was so scared. i cried...a lot. we prayed a lot. i never thought a year later i’d be sitting here feeling the best i’ve ever felt in my life. some blessings come in scary packages. 3 weeks old the doctor says i'm going through my first big growth spurt this week. which means i don't want mama to put me down and i am immediately soothed by dada singing talking to me my puppy sisters won't stop trying to give me all the kisses love. they are very protective of me like to sleep in my room while i'm napping. the weather and the water were absolutely perfect today. i didn’t want to come home! @funnyman06 loved celebrating with you today @alexstettler i am grateful for your friendship mentorship. because this lady was so persistent believed in me so much...because she said yes... i was able to say yes more like okayyy fine to an opportunity that i didn’t realize would change my life!! we are taught to look for jobs our minds are so closed to doing things that are non-traditional, or even doing things “out of order”. what if we let go of the lenses filters that have been put in front of us all our lives come back to the basics of who we are inside as individuals? it’s worth considering... this universe is abundant god is good. hi friends! it’s always been my dream to impact inspire as many lives as i can thru healthy living movement. although covid “stay at home” has been tough in many ways for many people, i’m grateful that it has pushed me to do something i’ve wanted to do for a long time. my yoga classes workouts are up on @spacemvmtco go subscribe move your body with me. you deserve this! i just added a beginner class per your requests there are more to come! unlimited access to power yoga flows strength training you can do from the comfort safety of your own home anywhere in the world! love you guys! enjoy! “...when no one was looking, she’d go near the cliff. for the closer she came to the edge the more she could h̠e̠a̠r̠, the more she could s̠e̠e̠, the more she could f̠e̠e̠l̠. finally, she stood at the very edge. she saw a light. she leaned out to touch it...and she slipped. and she flew!” quote guy, the croods it's major moves over here! friday august 7th we became homeowners!!! this was hard work for two kids with jacked up credit who created a family after loving each other since high school! super proud and grateful for this to be my new home! i really would like to thank my husband @cruizecontrol4 the amount of work he put in at work to make sure our funds was straight was crazy. as i sit in my new bedroom writing this i can't help to get emotional! we wanted this for so long and finally our time came! we did it! i woke up in tears having a complete breakdown this morning. i had a terrible dream that a police officer hurt my man. i’m reminded to practice a ton of gratitude and love today every day. it’s so sad that this is what’s deeply rooted in our fears our subconscious. it’s important we use our vote, our words, our platforms, our money, to speak up! let’s check ourselves, and let’s check our friends family. sometimes we will have hard conversations with people close to us, but it’s worth it. sometimes we will have to learn about people who are different from us, but it’s worth it. thanks for being brave. happy birthday @syd.debus! i hope all of your boys spoil you on your special day! you deserve all best life has to offer! miss and love you lots! doing new things can be hard annoying and sometimes the necessary steps we must take to get where we are headed just can’t be skipped or overlooked. taking the long road sometimes causes me to procrastinate, and then i start to over think or strive for “perfection”. i think producing results is about finding the balance between doing something well, also not procrastinating so much that your dream dies away. “done is better than good” is my fav saying lately haha. this saying reminds me to just start somewhere get moving. then i can go back in revise refine. what is everyone working on rn that you wish you could take the fast pass on, but you know the journey is worth the wait?? this! one of many unexpected blessings of my virtual business is my tribe. you may think that this is just all about “selling skincare but it’s so much more than that. don’t have a tribe like this? you are in luck because i am always looking to add a few more fabulous womenmen to love, encourage, support empower [not just on this journey but in life too]. find your tribe. love them big. “they convinced us to be afraid of ourselves. so we do not honor our own bodies, curiosity, hunger, judgment, experience, or ambition. instead, we lock away our true selves. women who are best at this disappearing act earn the highest praise: she is so selfless.” -glennon doyle we made a wish and you came true! there’s only one way to experience this adventure...together team machesky is moving to pittsburgh when the brother visits who’s officially no longer a “teen” you go all out. happy birthday to my niece, kimberlynn. this will forever be my favorite picture of us and i cannot wait to give it to you on your wedding day some day. love you to pieces, kiddo. i cannot believe you are nine. @jamers14 fam this guy goes back to work today. i cannot even begin to tell y'all how incredible these last weeks together have been for all of us as a family. this guy has been my rock [always has]. he cleaned, did laundry, finished the bathroom, did yard work, shopped, stayed up late, got up earlier, made meals, changed diapers, walked dogs, let me sleep.... all. of. it.... while i was healing from the birth of our sweet baby girl. i cannot thank him enough for spending all the time he did at home with his girls. we are forever grateful. have a good day, honey. stay safe. your girls miss you so much already and cannot wait to see you when you get home. we love you more than anything. “first day of school” pic! wyatt is starting 2nd grade, and this will be lilly’s last year in elementary school. where did my babies go!? good morning and happy monday!!! no need to be down! start your day with a grateful heart and tea!!!!!! what's in your tea? here's what's in mine: simply probiotic, collagen beauty booster, aloe and of course tea!!!!!!!! dm me for deets on how you can grab your tea!! lately i’ve been digging deeper to figure out which of the things i actually want which things i think i want based on what society tells me i should want as a woman. it’s important to me to decipher the difference between my inner knowing what i’ve learned or been conditioned to believe is right. what things help you to discover what you truly desire versus what you think you’re supposed to? i’m not even going to sugar coat it...today was hard. for all of us. we expected it but it still doesn’t make it any easier. first day of virtual learning for our oldest. packing has begun, boxes everywhere. plus all the other daily things that just happen. but you know what else happened today...lots of hugs lots of patience lots of breaks now i’m relaxing with a nice glass of white wine and a mound of clean clothes to fold. funny how i find that relaxing tonight. “when we let go of all expectation, there is peace.” @annetaftyoga seriously can’t wait to use this every morning! i make my coffee and wash my face. aka massage away dirt, oil, and smooth fine lines. literally a massage for my face every single morning! leaves my skin feeling so refreshed! love my lumi i had a girl in my downline text me this weekend she share that her side gig paycheck was doing something absolutely ahhhhh-mazing for her family. her significant other has to have a procedure done and with their current insurance they were going to have wait for months to have this much needed procedure done. but because of her hard work dedication to her virtusl business, she is able to pay out-of-pocket to get the procedure done now. you guys. this is what happens when you support small business. for most of us, this isn’t about a fancy car, a luxury vacation or even a 6 figure paycheck. it’s about helping real people pay real bills that would have otherwise struggled. that is what this side gig of mine is all about. this is what makes my heart smile. this is why i will continue to share this opportunity with everyone. forever tea in my cup!!! you may not understand but you gotta try it before you knock it! my tea helps burn btwn 80-90 calories, boost my energy, grows my hair and nail and finally keeps the following!!! i've been taking my products consistently for almost 3 years while while still enjoying the fun foods, 2 pregnanciesbreastfeeding and life!!!! i'm always working on me but now that my youngest is approaching 1yrs its time to level up and push for these new results! link in the bio or dm me if you wanna do this thang with me! daydreaming about traveling, but grateful that i at least live by the beach. if you could go anywhere right now, where would you go?

where do we start? for me meditating, journaling, and moving my body help me get connected with my insides. what works best for you? happy birthday, to my little brother! hope your day is filled with lots of love happiness! p.s. you're getting old! dear husband, please know how much i love you! i appreciate and see everything you do for us on a daily basis! you are the hardest working man i know! sometimes i look at you and wonder how i got so damn lucky to be your wife! i just love you honey, more than you will ever know! p.s. your daughter clearly agrees. i mean, just look at the way she looks at you! love, wife are you a doer or a dreamer? me? let me fill you in on a 'lil secret! for many, many years i was a dreamer. i was a wishful thinker i dreamed of doing bigger things. but, let me tell you, it wasn’t until an opportunity was presented to me that i turned my dreams into actions began doing the do to reach them. have i reached all of them? of course not, but you won’t reach your dreams if you don’t begin taking action on them. so no matter what you’re “dreaming of” trust me when i say it’s time to take action take the leap. how often do you take a photo and still don't feel like you took it right???? don't get caught up in perfection, it's your imperfections that make you perfect! 2020 has went from being the year to a different type of year! to me this year means learning how to adapt! how to look on the bright side! how to weather the storm! personal development has taught me how to keep moving when there is uncertainty, how to push until! super grateful for the opportunities we had even in the midst of it all! but we are only half way through and we have way more work to do! here's to part 2 of 2020! we are coming for it allllllllll!!!!! the color of the straw may change but my healthy smoothie is a constant! pumpkin spice sweet n nice i found a career that helps me reach my dreams...by accident. a few years ago i met a woman at yoga who had a branded water bottle that i recognized. my skin was a mess i didn’t know how to eat to maintain the level of energy i needed for my dance fitness industry jobs. this woman helped me thru my process of feeling confident in my own skin, recommended a skincare regimen that she knew i’d benefit from, helped me dive into a clean eating program that has forever changed the way i care for my body. fast forward to me going out on a limb saying “yes”... jk it was more like a “okay fine... sure, i’ll give it a try” when @alexstettler asked me to join her in the business of helping people live better flourish. i truthfully did not think this type of business network or social marketing was for me. i did not want to be a sales person. my journey to the top 2 was fast! it wasn’t typical, but it was exciting! i didn’t stop or slow down too much to wonder if this was what i was supposed to be doing because i just had this amazing feeling in my gut in my heart that this opportunity fell into my lap for a reason...in perfect timing. through hard work, dedication, love, persistence, grit, consistency i built a business that i am beyond grateful for. i earned two incentive trips in the last two years to tropical destinations, earned countless gifts achievement awards, was given the opportunity to enroll in the mercedes benz program for vps, gained a community of friends that are so uplifting inspiring, and with my organization have helped thousands of people live better!! some days when i’m working from home, scheduling a fun activity or a trip into the middle of my week, or on a team huddle zoom with my friends, i have a moment where i’m still in total awe over all of this!! what opportunities do you have right in front of you that you’ve put your blinders up to? what if you believed you were worthy of the life you dream of living?? nothing is guaranteed. results are different for everyone. for typical earnings, visit earnings.arbonne.com slow down time! let me have these moments forever! good vibes positive thoughts towards ourselves!! loving from within knowing what we are are not is so important. then no matter what someone else says about us or to us, we know the truth the truth is enough. @alyssastefekphoto it never really gets easier to watch your hubby go on storm. and if it has for you you have to share your secrets with me. he just left and i'm already in tears. missing him. praying for safe travels. praying for careful rebuild and restore. [i'd love for him and his crew to be in your prayers too, if you are the praying type.] loving him every single second. wondering how i will manage to keep it together here at home. justin eian. your girls miss you so much already. call us every chance you get. be safe driving and please be careful working. no shortcuts. we love you more than anything. i’ve got that friday feeling look what just landed on my doorstep! this is my secret weapon to smoother firmer skin just ask my thighs! most of these are shipping right back out today, but i have a few left up for grabs! shoot me a dm to get all the deets! rest easy chadwick! thank you! these girls are our such good protectors! even though they are driving me s, i'm so grateful to have them keeping watch over us. love my furbabies! another adorable home in durham! i love the bright colors! not only did paisley sleep for a 4 hour stretch, followed by a 5 hour stretch last night, but she helped me clean the house this morning. she even took a long enough nap for me to mow the yard and shower. i'm taking that as a huge win for the week. happy sunday, friends. damn. i took a walk tonight cried the entire time. i have some heavy, deep things i’ve been moving through this year. aren’t emotions wild?! i just thought i’d share this so that if you spent a day or a week or a month crying recently, know you’re not alone. tonight i’m reminding myself that god chose me created me. i have nothing to prove to anyone besides myself him. i am free to make choices that make me happy bring me joy. and the more love i have for myself, the more love i can spread share shine on others around me. dripping on you. love you. hello to september!!!! so excited for my favorite month of the year!!! the weather cools off, hoodies and thick leggings make their appearance and not to mention its my birthday month!!!! 2020 has not been to kind but we gonna end this year with a bang!!! i’m so grateful for the opportunity to help people be healthy for the opportunity to help people grow! in yoga we say “namaste”. to me, this one word has so many meanings. most importantly though, it means two things to me: we are all one. united in this space, in this time, here to work together be a collective force. as much as you learn from me, i learn from you- even if i’m the teacher, the leader, or the one holding space. sending loving energy positive vibrations out today by first taking care of myself, and then second manifesting love unity for all. thanks for letting me get mushy on here. love you all. just wanted to say hi it's wednesday besides work what's the move??

it really helps me feel purposeful and intentional to take some me time in the morning before i start my work day. i love to drink a detox tea fizz or a homemade latte. i love to meditate journal then do a little reading! not every morning has to be the same, but having a list of things that make you feel good that you can do on your own is so for success. what are your fav things to add to your morning routine?? aaaaand we’re here! when i say we’re off the beaten path, i mean it! about 20 minutes worth of driving summed into 25 seconds. this is the life @smithlakeal now this is a view every morning i wake up and get some “work” done for my online biz before my kiddos wake up. it’s such a blessing that i can work my business from anywhere. this weekend is no different. it may be a holiday weekend and we may be on vacation, but to me that’s just more motivation to be able to provide for my family under any circumstances. here, there, anywhere! it's been over week w justin working storm and it hasn't been easy for any of us [justin, paisley, the pups or me] but i am proud of all of us. it is moments like this that remind me why i am so thankful to work from home full time now. sure, i'm running on less sleep and i basically do everything during naps with paisley sleeping on my chest but i am also not missing a single snuggle or moment with this little girl. because, gah, she is already growing up way too fast. livin` that @smithlakeal we’re a lot, but it’s for the best. grateful for this woman @shantani.moore wait til you guys hear the podcast we recorded the other day!! afternoon delight! puppy snuggles! “life itself is a privilege. but to live life to the fullest—well, that is a choice.” andy andrews no captions needed @smithlakeal you guysssss i’m so excited!! i just dropped my first show with brynn moves the podcast!!!! this has been one of those things i dreamed of doing, but put off... until recently when i said “f it let’s go”! putting ourselves out there doing new things is hard, but honestly not as hard as keeping it in having the feeling later of regret for not showing up showing out!! i am blessed and honored to have @shantani.moore as my first guest! we share stories about testing our bodies physically what that means mentally emotionally for us as well. click the link in bio to listen! don’t forget to post tag me share the podcast with a friend who needs to hear it too!! it’s always hard saying goodbye to one of our favorite places with our favorite people. but clearly not as difficult as standing close to you sister. happy labor day! drink of choice: fizz! having your own wellness business is a lot of work!! and it also comes with it’s perks! oh my gosh do y’all see that action!?

i love to talk about breakfast how this is a huge part of my morning routine! it doesn’t matter what time you eat, it matters what you eat! our bodies are our vehicles so it’s crucial to put the proper fuel in them!! my fav morning routine: skincare, tea, protein smoothie, meditate, journal, gratitude list! good morning!!! i never thought i would be a stay at home mom! i actually didn't want kids when i hit middle school because we did a project that showed the cost of a family then i fell in love with my childhood friend that use to sit in my moms car at the bus stop and here we are! i never thought i would own an international business and working to open more! what i love about what i do is that it allows me to help people reach their goals then boom i'm crossing things off too! i got to the point in life where i was searching for more...i found it! if your searching too lets chat! you never know where your yes! will take you! the older i get, the more protective i get of my energy. i don’t waste it on people who don’t love me for me. and i don’t waste it on people who don’t deserve an ounce of my time or my heart. i choose my circle. and i’m choosing people who have the same values as me. the same morals. the same lives i want to live. people who i never have to question where we stand. people who not only talk the talk, but also walk the walk. that intuition you feel when you’re around someone who isn’t good for you? you know that feeling? that “something is off but i don’t quite know what” feeling? trust it. your subconscious mind processes information much faster than your conscious mind does. it’s the reason you vibe so well immediately with some and not so much with others. your brain knows who is good for you and who isn’t, way before your heart does. so in case you needed to hear this right now and no one has told you before, you aren’t a mean girl for putting up boundaries from those who weren’t meant to be in your circle. you get the final say in who is good for your soul and who isn’t. it’s not an attack. it’s not mean. and it’s not only healthy to set some up, it’s absolutely necessary. those boundaries aren’t for them—they are for you. your energy. your heart. your vibe. your vision. your mission. and most importantly, your peace. not my words. copied from a friend. this was a pretty sweet moment. for the first time in a long time, i was able to take my boys out and go shoe shopping. and as you can tell, they don’t exactly have cheap taste all thanks to my social media biz, i didn’t have to worry about waiting till my next pay check, or putting this on a credit card. we are completely debt free! so thankful i found this 2.5 years ago. my only regret is not finding it sooner. the extra income has helped my family so much, and the community, support, and success trips are just icing on the cake just in case you’ve missed it before, it’s z. e. r. o. cost! $0.00. no website fees, or order minimums, no kits or inventory requirement. just your smart device and wifi! if you’re looking for some extra income, a community, or just ready to travel to world, you can do this too! ps. it’s celebrating that new new!! love working training alongside these boss babes! it's the weekend mya is with us but she never wants to take a photo. hubby was in the beer distributor. i hope y'all have a great weekend!!! just because i miss you dose continue to watch over your little brother he literally follows you everywhere! syire don't worry your big bro and big sis got you! my life can be hectic but these kids and their smiles make it worth it! even if they never know it i give them everything i have! i'm grateful for my babies!!! need. coffee. now. paisley decided we needed to have a party from 2:30 to 4:30 this morning. of course i couldn't fall back asleep. being up so early means i had a productive morning: mowed the lawn, got the trash out to the curb, patched the dead spots with new seed, watered the lawn, fixed a sprinkler head took a shower. naptime, finally. hey. wanna know what helps me be a better partner?? having a morning routine. lately i’ve been falling out of my morning routine not taking it as seriously it really takes a toll on my mental emotional well-being. when our cup is not full, it’s hard to pour into the ones we love because we don’t have much overflow. for me, it’s really important to practice self care for me, but also for the ones i love. episode 2 of brynn moves the podcast is up it’s all about morning routines setting boundaries. link in bio!! we are worthy! i have a special guest on the show that offers tons of insight: @leiladylla check it out let me know what you think!! while i’m not totally ready to let go of summer, i did put on my favorite fall lippie today. still drinking my caramel macchiato cause i’m also boycotting all things pumpkin spice until the the first official day of autumn. let me love you a little more before you're not little anymore. eek! look at what just showed up on my doorstep! best dang lotion i’ve ever used! it’s a must have before going outside in the mucky humid weather, but i also love that it keeps my skin moist and helps my insta-tan last longer! win-win! go find out why my friends are loving it, too https:www.facebook.comgroups563142947370632?refshare you know what- this whole pandemic thing has been really, really strange sometimes super frustrating and challenging. i bet together we could come up with 100 more words to describe the negative impact it’s had... and i bet we can also come up with 100 ways it’s helped us grow pushed us out of our comfort zones, strengthened our relationships or helped us figure out where we are lacking boundaries. what about the new skills we have learned? the time we have had to spend on ourselves things we love? what about the family time, the time to read, the time to exercise, the time to cook be creative?? those things are huge blessings. god is with us. everything happens in it’s perfect timing. i cannot wait for these two to enjoy some snuggle time together. she sure misses her dada. a few years ago i switched from coffee to fizz!! i didn’t realize the side effects coffee was having on my body until i stopped drinking it. i would have never done this on my own, but with the support of my amazing healthy living community i was able to have daily accountability as i made exchanges for many of my not-so-healthy habits. fun facts: coffee is highly acidic is one of the most sprayed crops pesticides and how many of us were honestly grinding our own organic coffee beans every morning? often times coffee in western culture coffee shop coffee with tons of added sugar, artificial dyes sweeteners, tons of calories. everyone is different, but what i’ve learned is de-stressing the body by limiting addictive or inflammatory foods drinks can be a game changer for our overall well-being!! feeling good. feeling grateful. if you need accountability or support in shifting to some healthier habits i got you!! an oldie but still a goodie! well it's not that old! lol i'm home a lot with my kids ever since i chose to stay home but i still like to explore and find my next adventure! i'm looking to expand the team! you just need to be willing to help yourself and help others at the same time! the opportunity is for everyone but only you can decide if its for you! hit me for the link for tonight's meeting!!! being an entrepreneur isn't always glamorous. in fact, most days i am in leggings with a tee shirt. and if i have showered it’s a really good day. working from home isn't always glamorous either. especially with an infant, a mess everywhere you look and two non-stop barking dogs. but. the freedom to choose to work from home, when i want to work and how i want to work is worth it! i wanted freedom to be my own boss and work around my family. i now have a successful business that allows me to contribute to my family financially and be a stay at home mommy to our daughter. i am 100 thankful for that. today’s home owner was so thrilled with our staging, he almost moved back in! @trianglestaginganddesign full color pics in my stories! happy friday!! cheers to building a life by design. a life of choices. a dream life! you are so worthy, capable, deserving!! weeks this handsome guy has been on storm for three weeks now. that is days we have gone without our main man. we miss him so bad cannot until we hear that he gets to come home. we are so proud of his hard work to help rebuilt restore power to thousands of people after hurricane laura. we love him more than anything. 2 months old oh, paisley grace! you are perfect! dada, mama sisters love you so much! smiles all the time! cooing baby talk!! head control is getting better! loves music being outside! in 0-3 month clothes finally! started having a few visitors! “my mother told me to be a lady. and for her, that meant be your own person, be independent.” -ruth bader ginsburg you know what’s awesome- not just having a mom that encourages you to be bold, but having a father that encourages women’s empowerment as well. my dad mourned the loss of rbg yesterday, knowing that her work for women’s rights was crucial for our country. women’s rights aren’t just for women to worry about, they’re for men to fight for too! thank you, dad, for teaching me to stand up for myself. just like equality for poc the fight against racism belongs to all of us too. together, we rise. virgo shit stepping out with the ladies but stepping into age 31! it's the smirk for me! we are celebrating our birthdays! tomorrow is my day! 920 virgo shit stepping out with the ladies but stepping into age 31! it's the smirk for me! we are celebrating our birthdays! tomorrow is my day! 920 i ate a burger before this photo shoot. happy sunday. this makes me happy! happy is a choice! i choose happiness, love, family and me! had an amazing weekend and the party ain't over yet!! thank you for all the love....now i'm 31 and here for all the fun!!! hi! when’s the last time you checked in took note of who you’re spending most of your time around?

tea time is the best time!! especially on a beautiful sunday morning! this tea boosts my metabolism, helps improve my skin's elasticity, reduces my bloating and tastes freaking amazing! get with me to get yours!!! look at my mug if you haven't guess by now i have an obsession! fall isn’t so bad when it still feels like summer. for the first time ever, i am decorating for fall and to be honest, this is the first time i’ve ever been able too. once again, i’m so grateful for my online business. it allows me to do extra things i wasn’t able to do in the past. i already mentioned before that i used to count how many hours i needed to work in order to pay the next bill. but now i have more freedom with my time. annnnndd now i have all the pumpkins. definitely going back for more soon, to complete the look! lilly really enjoyed helping me pick these out! so i was thinking last night when we couldn't get to sleep. grace is hands down the answer to everything in every situation. most people often think of giving grace to others, but often overthink the idea of giving grace to ourselves. “give yourself some grace.” it's so easy to say, but so hard to do. being kind to yourself is so huge when it comes to self acceptance, love and success in other relationships. seriously though friends, what would you say to your best friend if she was going through a hard time? then why don’t we talk to ourselves like that? today, i challenge you to give yourself grace in an area you are struggling with. go ahead, friends. you. can. do. it. great morning and happy monday! finishing up some notes on a small part of our team call i missed last night! starting my day by taking responsibility and getting any and all information provided in order for growth! having children and running a business only presents a minor challenge its not an excuse or crutch. so this morning i decided while they have breakfast and i enjoy my tea...get it done! grateful to be able to do this around them and literally anywhere, even my so you say you want to reach your goals but you never take the step to achieve it! saying 'yes!' to working on yourself can manifest way more than a physical result! that's what i learned by opening my first cannister 3 years ago! this is the moment to take the stepleap! are you in? dm or comment below hbd to my babe. to many more years around the sun- while wearing matching outfits forever ever. national coffee day tastes a little better from my new coffee mug curtesy of @samanthabpare! how do you take your coffee??

what about it do you love most!!! a little berry scrub masque to end my night i use my berry scrub to brighten my skin, even the texture, and diminish age spots what do you use a masque for? happy october!! we are officially heading into the last months of the year! today i had to add another cap on and be a prek teacher! dose's first day of prek is going better now but for morning circle i wasn't sure how the day was going to go! thank goodness for personal development because i now know to focus what we can control! dose is getting a lesson that we are doing something new but he can do it! proud of my boy! we are welcoming visitors to meet paisley. but we ask that you please. wash your hands before cuddling no kisses, your germs are too big reconsider visiting if you are sick, recently been sick or have been around someone who is sick to set up a daytime, please message me. thank you for understanding helping us keep our babygirl healthy. little girls soften their daddy's hearts! i miss you, dada! come home soon! hello october i’ve been challenged to share my favorite skincare device for the next days! today, selfie! i’m blown away by the hype happening around this magic device! so many friends joining the to upgrade their skin! here’s to more youthful, clearer skin! let. me see your naked face selfie! guess who rolled over yesterday for the first time?!?

fresh coffee from @lorrainescoffeehouse27529, fresh pedi, clearance sandals from @targetbargains. this is my kind of wednesday. anyone else tired as a mother? today has been a struggle! this face makes it all worth it. what if as a society we start to teach our girls to eat well to be strong healthy rather than “skinny”? what if we truly celebrated different body types recognizing that there is no “perfect” mold? what if we took one minute to remember that just being thin doesn’t mean that our body is flourishing? i almost didn’t post this photo because i was distracted by how “big” my legs are. this has been an insecurity of mine my entire life because “girls are supposed to be thin soft”. i’m not kidding- i never wore a pair of shorts to middle or high school. i hated that my legs were “big” aka athletic strong!! ...but i didn’t see myself that way. i just saw big. i caught myself with these negative thoughts today and was like hold up- this photo is dope you’re strong af holding that perfect forearm stand which is not easy took me years to hold!!!

my forever hairstylist!!! thank you for always fitting me in! yesterday nothing happened the way i planned it. and... i still had a really great day! i had a choice to be resistant, get upset, get anxious. or i had a choice to be fluid, stay positive, practice non-attachment to the way i thought things were supposed to go. our happiness comes from within how we perceive things is up to us! check out brynn moves the podcast- a new episode released today i chatted alllll about shifting our perspective, embracing change, how to go with the flow. link in bio!! can’t wait to hear your feedback! this kid is a problem tell the eagles it's the lemon lime blast liftoff for us! claypool @herbalife sharing some of my fav things!!! saying no can be the best form of self-care... easton’s school started 5 days a week today fin is back to school after i kept him home last week with a snotty nose i have 1 hour a day that the boys school schedules actually over lap. today is the day i start taking care of myself again. i am saying no to doing laundry, cleaning the house, and grocery shopping. i am going for a walk for 1 hour. my goal is to complete this 3-4 times this week. getting started again has been difficult, but i’ve realized to be the best mom and wife that i can be i have to take care of myself also. do you have a daily self care activity? how do you make sure you stick to it? being a mother- is learning about strengths you didn't know you had dealing with fears you didn't know existed. love this sweet girl. have you ever felt so busy trying to be the old version of yourself that you can’t make way for the new version? we must be open to changing some things that worked for us before, to align with where we are headed now. this might seem a little scary, but staying the same forever would be even worse. flashback to tulum!! anyone else dying to travel again?! if you could go anywhere in the world right now, where would it be? someday is not coming. 2020 has been an adventure. over the past 10 years life has changed in so many ways for me. i continue to grow as a person, a leader, a mother, a friend, etc. however, i felt like i needed something more. i wanted to grow. fast forward to fall 2018- i joined a company who is expanding like crazy. in 2019 we launched into two new countries and launched our skincare line. {do you remember? $2 million sold in less than 4 hours} a billion dollar hair care company in less than 5 years the addition of skincare just last year, we are on our way to hitting one billion in one year. fall 2020- we launched wellness products. and here’s why this is the best time for you: global expansion- puts you at yet another ground floor opportunity with a launch into a new country. we are currently in 5 countries, in 5 years, and there’s more coming. new products- puts you at yet another ground floor opportunity as we launch into a brand new industry. wellness- everyone is taking note of what they are putting on and in their bodies. why not join a company with cutting edge, scientifically backed anti-aging vegan beauty and wellness??? this gift for me can be a gift for you, if you let it. where else can you invest $199 and turn it into unlimited income with a 30 day money back guarantee? nowhere. someday is not coming. you are only guaranteed today. and after all, what do you have to lose? gratitude! when i started my entrepreneurial adventures, i never in a million years imagined i’d be where i am today. the immense feeling of gratitude i carry in my heart is what moves me forward daily. part of why i didn’t see myself here is because i didn’t believe i was deserving. maybe consciously i thought so, but sub-consciously i couldn’t even image being worthy of owning an apple watch let alone $800 pairs of shoes, nice handbags, jewelry leading a team driving a luxury car, having vacations paid for, having my own platform sharing on a podcast, affording my own space in la, or attending events in full length gowns taking photos on a step repeat i literally didn’t know what this was called until like 2 years ago lol i’m saying all of this because our relationship to money, shiny things, status is important in the sense that- what if we are holding ourselves back from impacting lives or being an inspirational female role model, or helping people be their personal best, all because we don’t believe we are deserving of the “success” or the “stuff” that comes with growing a business building an empire?? are you playing it small?? do you truly believe you are deserving?? i’m done playing it small each and every time i choose to level up i have to check in with myself ask these same questions. for arbonne results vary nothing is guaranteed. see earnings.arbonne.com for more info. second week of prek!

or you want to start but....but...but??? confidence is quiet. insecurity is loud. thanks for reminding me of this today @alexstettler anytime we feel like we need to shout, we could benefit from taking a moment to ask ourselves why. what is the deeper feeling about this? why am i sharing or shouting this? what does it mean does it align with my mission higher self? am i posting this or sharing this because it’s true to me, or because other people are doing it so i feel like i need to as well? this is something i’ve been still am working on. the check in is constant it keeps us honest helps us keep our integrity. who's an athlete??? everyone is!!

oh, my sweet pup! this girl has been having some health issues since she went through heat- dry flakey skin, hair loss in patches, excessive scratching licking which led to scabs sores. she went to the vet about 4 weeks ago and we started treating her for mites [even tho there were none] but treatment didn't help she got worse. last night she went back we are now treating her for allergies. hoping this is it she finds some relief. this girl definitely drives me bananas most days but i love her sooooo much. get out there and vote!

let yourself go there! it’ll all be worth it! when i look at you, i wonder how i got so damn blessed! thank you for always making me and the girls your priority! i love our life together! buckle up, buttercup! why do we tell ourselves lies? why do we believe the lies we tell ourselves? why do we self-sabotase? it will never get better. this is just how i am. my life will never be good again. god won’t forgive me. i can’t forgive them. i can’t forgive myself. i won’t be able to get over this. you can’t trust anyone. god doesn’t care. the danger is that lies don’t just pass through our thoughts but these lies comsume our beliefs. a lie that we believe becomes a limitation that steals our possibility. that limitation then becomes a resignation of defeat preventing us from moving forward and moving on. i’ve learned to listen for these defeating lies. and then reject those thoughts with immediate prayers. -lysa terkeurst feminine is powerful true or false?? getting into the halloween spirit! can you guess what my kids are dressed up as? @funnyman06 i’ve got a spooky deal on this beauty wand today! stay at home mom motherhood as a whole is sooooo many things. it is beautiful impossible perfect overwhelming hilarious never-ending. it is glorious insane all at once. but i believe it is the best job in the whole world. now that i know what it’s like to be present for all the daily moments with paisley, i couldn’t not be there for them. it’s not for everyone. and that’s okay. it’s more than okay. but, it’s totally for me. yeah, my kids are cute. but only because of this handsome stud. happy halloween @funnyman06 we can’t cancel halloween!!

join me in this journey. thanks for the love support, my friends. means the world. nothing is guaranteed. results are different for everyone. for typical earnings, visit earnings.arbonne.com definitely just finished washing my face in the dark anyone else’s power go out? y’all stay safe out there! i don’t have time. i can't afford it. it won’t work. it's one more thing i’d fail at. all of the things i told myself while watching others slay it at life. girlfriend, i know your excuses feel real. mine did too. but at some point you have to choose between what you want now and what you want most. the world is full of noise. you can’t. you shouldn’t. it won’t work. you’ll fail. it goes on and on. all too often that noise comes from within. stop letting your excuses call the shots. you are the only one in control of you. so silence the noise. you are one decision away from everything you want! sometimes you have to just take it out for a test drive!!! i did! i looked at my husband back in 2017 and said what do we have to lose? we need to do this for our children! we ordered one for each of us and decided to go all in! after 5 days i dropped 9lbs and he dropped 11lbs and we knew this was it and immediately order a full program. who knew that we would go on to drop 90lbs and a business opportunity would flourish! while this is not always typical but surely what is possible i get to help you as your coach and get you the best result we can get! all it takes is you! you have to make the decision! trust the process, stick with me and we can change your life...but only if you want to! people who use herbalife formula 1 twice a day as part of a healthy lifestyle can generally expect to lose around half a pound to 1 pound per week. people are going to judge you for doing something. and people are also going to judge you for not doing something. there’s no way out. so how do you decide what to do, what to post, how to look, what to say? dive inward, get to know yourself, and then make choices that are authentic and genuine to you. i’ve heard countless stories lately seen so many comments and dms people are receiving where someone is trying to tell them what to do. this is wild to me i wanted to offer some advice no matter which end of the spectrum you’re on. 1. people are going to do what they’re going to do. stop trying to change them, and change yourself instead. 2. if something someone is doing, posting, saying, etc is bothersome to you, you have the power freedom to unfollow, mute, create boundaries, or block. and that’s okay!! we shouldn’t ever feel bad about protecting our own energy. 3. go inward ask yourself why you feel the need to tell someone what to do or give them feedback they didn’t ask for!!! i always say this: “millions of mirrors”. the things that bother you the most about someone else reveal your insecurities about yourself!! our triggers are our teachers our guide to know what to work on next in our personal development. 4. if someone gives you advice you didn’t ask for- ask yourself if the advice adds value if you value the opinion of the person it came from. if the answer is no, then it’s okay to let it go. if we let everything people say to us effect us or change us, we will completely lose ourselves. be you️be brave trust your happy world kindness day!!! it takes no real effort to be kind! always be kind and if you encounter someone not so kind then kill them with kindness! caring for your skin should be the 1st step in your self-care routine. take care of your body’s largest organ while boosting your mental health too. when your skin looks feels good you naturally feel better about yourself. do you have a skincare routine? begin yours this weekend and get our sleep drops for free!! are vests still “in” not asking for a friend friday vibez happy saturday starting my day off the only way i know how and that's with a liftoff what is a liftoff you ask? it's a clean energizing boost packed with vitamin c and energy-supporting b vitamins: b1, b2, b3, b5, b6, b7 and b12!

these are only available 1-2x a year and one jar will last about 2 years! i’m putting together a pre order list for my friends! don’t miss out, let me know if you want to simplify your routine too!! finishing up week of my 30 day clean eating program. i’m feeling good inside great about how i’m looking on the outside. our outer self is a direct reflection of our inner health. i’ve been taking amazing classes with my friends at @spengapasadena working out a bit at home too, but mostly i’ve just been focusing on this reset fueling my body properly. it’s def not about perfection, but rather progression. ps. i’m in love with these new leggings from @athleta the company is a b-corp like @arbonne which is not easy to become! b-corps balance profit, people, the planet. looking forward to the next two weeks. let’s go!! the typical results are different for everyone. results vary based on body composition, age, individual effort, eating patterns, exercise and the like @athletala i do this, so i can take selfie’s like this! this little device keeps my skin clean and radiant! most days i leave the house with only a little lip color. good morning it's monday!!! so last night this dude was not this happy! i put him and his brother in their room and he had a fit! it was a nice 2 12hrs after i had to put him down multiple times before both of them were back in my bed because of the wind and rain! hopefully tonight will go better! yup time to get my bed back to just me and my husband i'm grateful to have enough room for them to have their own space but enough room in my bed where we can all snuggle together happy monday! story time: i used to eat like crap. lol. i grew up in the 90s eating sugar everything. everything... if you know you know. in college i thought i ate well, but i was eating only as well as i knew how. nobody teaches you this stuff!! nutrition is something i had to learn about on my own. i got sick a lot, was not in my best shape, had low energy, my skin was a mess. i was eating foods i had sensitivities to probably due to poor gut health i didn’t even know! i was interested in feeling quite honestly, looking better too. i am excited to now feel my best be in the best shape of my life at age 29. i’m happy to help guide you to your optimal health be there for you as you reach for your wellness goals. let’s chat!!

@trianglestaginganddesign it’s getting hectic around here. first round of moving starts in 5 days. finishing school for 1 kid. last week coming up for the other. working. cleaning. laundry. food. all the things. i can tell everyone is starting to feel the stress. we all handle it differently. when this guy asked me to watch him play a game on his ipad, first i thought of the 900 things i was trying to complete. then i stopped and thought about all the emotions he must be feeling too. taking a few minutes to sit and with him, watching him play a game, helped fill his emotional bucket. simply taking time to slow down, attend, and fill others buckets with acts of kindness, a listening ear, or just being close by is so important. when things get stressful over the holidays, or anytime really, remember to take a breath and remember others. bet it makes you feel better too obsessed with all the new vegan face masks, skincare, make up palettes from @arbonne we can change our clothes, we can wear different shoes, we can style our hair differently, but our face is something we have to wear every day ladies and gentlemen we deserve nice skin skin that we are proud of. think about how much more confident you’d feel having skin you love. good morninggggg. have a fabulous weekend don’t forget to do something for yourself. my favorite combo!! i use this everyday as my styling finisher 1 pump 1 drop rub together in hands then throughout hair. you’ll be amazed!! today was awesome! my city is closing back down due to covid but i was able to plug in to our sucess training seminar right from the comfort of my own home while taking care of my babies! 2020 has been different but i still had tremendous growth and i want to share that with everyone! come take a look! awesome fitness shoot yesterday for @mindbodymoney.show app! i also shared a short video about the many health benefits of physical activity! great for mind, body, heart health. improves sleep. supports healthy weight. boosts energy. helps us release feel good chemicals that ease depression anxiety. fun fact! higher fitness levels may offset adverse health consequences of prolonged screen time!! be kind it is easy to go about life feeling like everyone else has their shit together and that the things you struggle with are unique to you. but when you get down to it everyone [every single person i know], is dealing with profoundly difficult and stressful things. sometimes it is money, sometimes it is health, sometimes it is work or family or relationships. it is worth remembering this so that we cultivate some empathy when dealing with people, in general and in particular in difficult situations. i stopped waiting for the light at the end of the tunnel and i lit that btch up myself. thanks, but no thanks, on the unsolicited advice on how i should live my life. that’s how a lot of us are feeling rn, right?! i’ve had at least 6 convos this week with friends where they are feeling this way. remember, it’s okay to set boundaries with these people protect your own vision energy! and also, here are 3 tips for being a better listener so that we can lve on each other more tell each other what to do, less. 1. practice active listening- try not to be thinking about the next thing you are going to say while the other person is sharing with you. 2. ask more questions! rather than making assumptions, can you get curious about why someone is choosing what they are choosing? 3. put yourself in their shoes practice empathy over sympathy. comments like- “well it could be worse” or “at least it’s not fill in the blank” generally can make people feel worse. try things like- “thank you for sharing that with me” or “i understand that must feel really challenging”. rate 1-10 below on how helpful these tips are for you!! motherhood i think the best part of being a mama is when your little looks up at you and just smiles or stares because they know you are their person. like nobody else is as important as you. they know that you have them like nobody else will. the connection is indescribable. unknown yellow accents make me happy @trianglestaginganddesign it was my turn to go out and play in the snow with the kiddos today!!! we had a great time! 2020 has been a lot of things but hopefully you caught a glimpse of some vision for you and your family for 2021!!! it continued to snow after we finished playing so we probably will be back out there tomorrow! creating memories that will last a lifetime and preparing for major moves in 2021! what are you most excited about going into 2021???

messy living room...saturday training...my handsome babiesbeautiful daughter wouldn't change this for the world! happy saturday just a girl her puppy these two love each other so much! reesey always has to be where paisley is, watching over her! and paisley loves all the kisses! maybe one day abby will come around! i’ve always loved wines. claret is my all time fav. red blends are my jam right now. highly recommend the diamond red blend. cheers happy th birthday, abby! i can hard believe you've been with me that long. we have been through a lot together. thanks for being the best pup around. love you, abigail! hey there. me again- rocking my favorite sweater! promise i have other sweaters, i just wear this one the a lot anyway, wanted to make sure you guys new about my faaaaave beauty device! gentle enough to use 2x a day, and keeps my skin clean and smooth! it’s 15 off through the end of the day!!! run to my inbox. cause i only have a few promo codes up for grabs! it's here!!! it's really here!!! i'm truly excited for this product because of instead of mixing all of these outside items like pancake mix and etc... it's all in this canister!! just add my flavor choice of formula one and boom...so many options i'm so damn excited i don't even know what to make first??? but once i figure it out a video to follow!!! you can make these ask me how to grab your pbgm or just hit the link in the bio!!! it’s no surprise, really that i am a person who feels processes things deeply. if you know me, you know this is true. if you are anything like me, you probably tell yourself you “shouldn’t” be as emotional as you feel. or you “shouldn’t” show your intense emotions because they are more than other people show. maybe you hold those emotions in for fear of judgment. perhaps you are judging yourselves too? sounds exhausting right? i try to remind myself that it is a part of who i am it has played a major role in shaping myself as a compassionate understanding person. it's scary stuff to go through it's no wonder most people would feel more comfortable brushing these emotions under the rug. but let me say, you must bust out of those thoughts. be who you are, not who everyone expects you to be i promise you'll never want to leave. did you know that over 40 of small businesses are run by women?? and that that number is increasing? women emerging market! but did you also know that women historically choose careers with a lower pay scale due to our caring giving nature? or that many places of work believe it’s “cheaper to keep her”? or that often times women don’t ask for what they need because they don’t want to be needy, complain, be penalized for asking, or be labeled as a btch?? but women who do negotiate their pay end up earning over $1 million more over the span of their career than women who do not. as women in business we have to be out here encouraging and supporting other women in business!! what female business owners do you know? who can you support today?? support can look like posting giving a shout out on social. it can look like shopping from their business or getting a service from them. it can look like referring a friend or family member to them! ladies- let’s get it!! you are capable you are deserving you are worthy! the last time we got to go on a family vacation! syire was baking in the oven! oh how i miss traveling! seeing new places or visiting your favorite spot! trying new foods! just living, laughing and learning together! 2021 i hope we get back to more of this while still pushing for growth! think about these next statements... ”i just graduated college with 100,000 in debt”, yeah people clap, celebrate and even hug you. “i just got a loan for 400,000 to buy my first home”, yeah people clap, celebrate and even hug you. “i just got a loan for 40,000 for a new car”, yeah people clap, celebrate and even hug you. that’s 540,000 in total debt most people are living in but they are feeling good about it and they are being celebrated for it. now, go tell those same people you spent to start your own business... “whoa, are you sure?” “what are you going to do if it doesn’t work?” “umm.. i don’t think those things really work” “do you think you can get your money back?” my 200 investment has totally changed my life, my mind, my confidence, and my finances! not to mention my hair and skin! so, does 200 seem like an unreasonable investment in your life and financial future? you don’t have to give up your day job; you don’t have to abandon your kids to get this job done; you don’t have to be creepy and spam people for heavens sake please don’t do that!!! whether you’d like to make $500, $5000, $50k, or $500k it’s all obtainable. you work for what you want to make. i’m not going to fed you some lines about becoming a millionaire and buying luxury houses. real talk that’s me. let’s chat. see for yourself what i do and why it’s the best! give me a light or send me a message if you’d like to chat. you have nothing to lose lisa lisa loves me lots with the gloves on... just having some fun on a tuesday night since my bae out but was eating pineapples girl put your lipstick on anyone else have that one lipstick color that just empowers you?? for me it’s reign. this lippie just gives me confidence. even under my mask i just feel better the show must go on. heading into work this morning and then off to visit with anthony this afternoon. i love watching you as a daddy! i see the way you calmly respond to our daughter's sassy attitude. i love the sound of giggles as you bounce her swing her in the air. and the smile on her face when she looks at you, melts my heart. i love that even after 10 hour work day you come home with a smile on your face. you are doing this whole thing pretty damn good. another job well done by @trianglestaginganddesign how many of you have seen trolls world tour? which character do you relate to most? are you branch? almost always frowning, hiding in your bunker? do you appear grumpy from the outside but on the inside you really care deeply for others? or maybe you are more like queen poppy...the life of the party, always energetic determined and strong in your beliefs. are you more like queen barb? do you present a rough exterior while shielding a softer side? maybe a bit lonely wanting companionship? maybe, just maybe, you are like cooper a bit goofy, happy go lucky, but you’re searching for who you really are and what your purpose is. the good thing about this business is that you get to come as you are. you can have any and all of these characteristics and you can be successfully at this business. come as you are and i’ll show you the rest xoxo, your future mentor hey! celebrating a milestone small victory i’m almost 2 weeks into my 30 day reset and i’m more than halfway thru my health coaching program with the institute of integrative nutrition! i’m bringing a more in-depth 3 month 6 month coaching experience to you guys that i’m so pumped about! our health really is about more than just what’s on our plates. if you’re at all curious about this, let’s chat. in the meantime, i’ve created a new page resource for you! go follow @inspireempowerwellness as always, i’m forever grateful to be a part of your wellness journey. i mean how can these sales keep getting better and better?!?

driving from the south side of town to the north...you would have thought it snowed or something...slide to see outside my house!!! lol good ol pittsburgh weather!! friday’s are usually the toughest day of the week for me- strange that it’s not monday’s right haha! i feel like by friday i’m just exhausted idk it’s just that day for me. does anyone else have “that” day?? anyways, on friday i was really working to adjust my mindset to be in a more grateful positive space. one thing i’ve learned is it’s never too late to begin again or to have a shift of the mind. as i shifted my headspace to a place of positivity, calm, gratitude i felt a weight lifted from me. and my man surprised me by coming home with beautiful flowers for me!!! people really just want to be seen recognized. to me those flowers said, i was thinking of you i appreciate you. i wonder if i would have received flowers if i hadn’t have shifted my own mindset come into a more positive space. who in your life can you bring recognition to? who can you remind today that you love them or see them or hear them?? thinking we could all use a bit of good news over the holidays, our monat team adopted a family whose 2 year old was critically ill at duke’s children’s hospital. being able to take the holiday shopping stress off this family’s plate and provide gifts for their 2 older sons as well was amazing. this could have been this little ones last christmas with his family and because of the generosity of our team and everyone who gave, we were able to give them a christmas to remember while they concentrated on the important stuff...their family as a result of so much generosity, we were able to cross-off everything on our adopted family’s wish list! everything!! and!!!! we were also blessed to be able to gift them with the following: $200 gift card to dick’s sporting goods $400 gift card to target $400 gift card to walmart monat is deeply rooted in gratitude and the opportunities to help others because of this business are endless. it’s so much more than shampoo and selfies. helping others is what makes us who we are want to have a vulnerable moment talk about being sexy!! yep. ladies, some of us are really comfortable with this others of us are not. i’ve been thinking deeply about this, and i found myself hiding. hiding my legs, hiding things i saw as flaws, hiding my sexy side because i felt embarrassed. i sometimes feel like- who am i to put my body on display in this way? that’s the problematic thought right there. being sexy isn’t an act. you learn this in dance, especially when you train with the right choreographers. being sexy is about digging deep down pulling out the rawness of our femininity being confident, real, expressive. it’s about self love self esteem. not a specific body shape, not a specific figure, bra size, ass implant, lip injection, or hair length. gosh i wish i realized this sooner, but it’s never too late for a shift of the mind now the work begins. the work to find acceptance, compassion for self, comfort within exploration, and true sexy, feminine vibes. as my coach @leiladylla says- “she is powerful”. life does not get better by chance, it gets better by change! -jim rohn i am postpartum 1 year in the first photo and man was it a year! i was still breastfeeding my third child, being a wife and helping my older two kids with virtual school! sometimes us mommas are tired!!! but we will do anything for the ones we love right?

you can always join me when ready!! i'm a work in progress... let me explain. before being a mommy i would never not clean my house at least once a week, if not more. i love and take pride in having our home look nice. it's just something i've always done. probably get that from my mama. now, being a stay [work] at home mommy, i put pressure on myself to continue to do that. i must keep the house clean, the laundry done, the dishes done, the dogs clean, do all the things and still be a good wife, mommy, friend. why? why do i do this? will i win an award? will i get recognition? will it make me a better wife? a better mommy? a better friend? no! it absolutely will not. i've been working on it but it is a work in progress and probably always will be in some aspects. i am learning to give myself grace, give myself permission to leave things as they are sometimes. i am working on saying no, period to things. because truth is, no one cares if my house is clean or my laundry is done. no. one. care. i am so grateful for girl talk this week with some of the best people i know to remind me of this. i seriously have the best friends there are. i am blessed with a husband who tells me to spend the day relaxing and forget the rest when he sees me feeling burnt out [even though he works his ass off]. i am and will always be a work in progress. drop a or a comment below if you felt this on some level. tag a friend who needs to hear this or needs permission to just be. have you heard??? our skincare line has expanded let me introduce you to the purifying line be purified clarifying cleanser a purifying and refreshing gel cleanser with powerful botanical ingredients, formulated to gently reduce excess oil and unclog pores without drying the skin. be purified cold charcoal mask a unique cooling blend of mineral rich clays and purifying charcoal that deeply cleanses and helps refine pores. be purified oil free moisturizer a lightweight, oil-free moisturizer designed to help minimize visible shine while absorbing excess sebum and reducing the appearance of imperfections, giving skin a healthy appearance. spend $60 and get this line for only $35 message me asap to get your skin looking and feeling amazing!!

don't get stuck on perfect! go follow your dreams! 98 of people stay in their comfort zone...be in the 2!!! “obstacles are detours in the right direction.” @gabbybernstein in yoga we practice non-attachment. focusing on not getting “married” to one idea or one specific outcome, but instead enjoying the journey allowing ourselves to have an open mind heart. think of it as loosening your grip. leaving space. trusting. if we are super attached to one thing, one idea, one outcome, it becomes almost impossible for us to see anything else. when obstacles come they doesn’t have to be negative... they lead us in another direction. we have a plan for ourselves, but god has a greater plan. if getting ready for a snow day outting was really this easy i bet there are women out there who would sell their soul to be this free. @leiladylla sweet after school treat for the kiddos today what an awesome day!! a day to be kind. a day to pay it forward. a day to think of others. a day to remember everyone is battling something. i, for one, wish there were more days like this the boys and i wrote notes for others and delivered hand warmers to the school personnel that help with outside duties, like carpool, bus duty, etc. it feels good to do good. need some inspo for today? swipe to see some ideas on the let’s grow kindness chart all this winter weather has me ready for summer and tan skin. i use this instant tanning gel about once a week for the best, easiest self tan!

start to listen to the bumps nudges. begin to envision what your future holds. h͜͡a͜͡p͜͡p͜͡y͜͡ b͜͡i͜͡r͜͡t͜͡h͜͡d͜͡a͜͡y͜͡ to my baby daddy! 34 never looked so good! i love you so much! @funnyman06 today we staged these 2 condos in same building, 2 totally different vibes!

i love you all, and also you know i’m always here for some good old tough lve! we are creative creatures with the god given gift of choice! what are you choosing? a long time ago i removed the word “struggle” from my vocabulary. my friend mentor taught me to get up out of my own mud puddle. sure, you can roll around in that sh!t all you want, but like is that really what you want?? we will always, always face outside circumstances. how we choose to respond, react, and deal with them is what makes or breaks us. once again, you have choice so you don’t have to do this, but how good would it feel to get out of the mud, clean yourself up, get moving towards the incredible life of possibilities that’s ahead of you?? with so much love, -b let’s see how this turns out!

so here is how it's going! at a quick glance you may think not much is going on but look at the belly in each photo. what we see in the last three months is less protruding of the belly, belly button location has changed and the bottom of the belly is hanging different!

i know someone needs this today! most of us spend far too much of our life letting our fears hold us back when we are capable of so much more! the question i ask you now is... do you have the courage to chase after it? we traded the pumpkin costume for a baseball helmet and bat. tonight is weston’s first practice ever! great morning! being a mom of 3 means figuring things out even when you have your own plan, lol. i wanted to hit the gym early this morning but we are doing virtual school, having breakfast and personal development! no excuses though! results start in the kitchen but working out helps creates that caloric deficit! do you need help with your meal plan or homegym workouts? link in the bio for your free wellness evaluation! let's chat!!! a reclamation. i talk to women almost every day who tell me they’re exhausted, spend little to no time on themselves, and they aren’t very happy with their physical image or body. many women feel the need to keep up with other people. which in turn causes us to ignore or go against our natural rhythms. we then start to experience shame judgment or more shame judgement than we already were experiencing from deep societal conditioning. it breaks my heart. soooo i’ve decided to commit to my divine feminine reclaim my power as a woman. i am learning to soften around the edges, see the beauty in each of my female essences, and get to know my body. like really get to know my body. i feel resistance some days... almost a numb feeling, which my coach helped me understand is a trauma response. if you feel triggered by this post or the idea of diving into your feminine side makes you cringe, i get it!! if we can embrace our innate rhythm, if we can trust our intuition our bodies, if we can learn to create sacred practices around loving ourselves, we will be able to step into each area of our lives authentically full, while bringing our beautiful, creative energy to the surface! ladies, we deserve this. you deserve this. first day at swim school i am so proud of this girl. she was so brave and had a lot to take in. she worked on reaching forward for a ball, kicking her feet, supermans, back floats, water safety, climbing out of pool, jumping in and motor boat floating [all assisted w mama of course]. seriously, this girl is a little all-star. before afters are not only for hair heading into the weekend like... @electricandrose saturday spotlight meet @mommaqueen412 aka morgan i've known this momma of twins for years!

morgan is an rn, so with her career, schooling for masters and the twins logan regina busy is an unstatement but she does it anyway. she committed to see what happens if she kept going. how taking care of herself can lead to better living for her and her babies!

ahhh, yes! two people with the personality numerology number 3 are in sync. it’s a dream to be able to draw out the creative potential in one another. and since you both have the gift of gab and like helping and inspiring people, it could be magical if you both dug deep into life to help each other focus and grow. you can hold hands and hop merrily down the bunny trail of life, picking up wisdom along the way! kekal sihat dengan meningkatkan sistem imunisasi badan, dengan siri produk dari mrt elken 3 and 4 in love as far as compatibility numerology, this is a classic match! it’s that age-old thing that opposites attract! this couple can either be the peanut butter to each other’s jelly… or totally crash and burn. you’re spontaneous, she’s the micro-manager. she’s a little uptight and anxious you show her how to let her hair down and have some fun! with this couple, it comes down to acceptance of each other’s ways. but if you can get to acceptance which, by the way, is one of the greatest parts of love you’ve completed one huge lifetime task, so celebrate! a 3 feels things and wants to live with the wind in their hair, while our dear 4 can be a bit… um… anal! it’s okay though, fuddy-duddy’s are endearing. plus, they totally obey the rules, are stalwart and true, and can be counted on in panicked situations hello husband, are you reading this?… 4 would rescue you number 3 from the dire results you might create with your lack of focus or discipline to get the job done. keep a list of the good things about one another, because as far as numerology compatibility, this couple is soooo complimentary! 4 is more of a rock, and 3 is kind of a hard place with your frivolity and lack of desire to put your shoulder to the plow with any kind of regularity. with 3 and 4 in a numerology love match, you can both learn a lot from one another. and at the end of the day, give each other a high-five for the support you gave one another seriously, 4’s need to let loose like this a little. today was definitely one of those day i didn’t want to come to the gym because of the woman’s monthly time. but you know what i still came killed it and sweated my ass off did you workout today would you like a coach i can definitely help you work on your results link in my bio 3 and 5 in love this numerology love match can be a very social combination. you know that couple that sits together in a gourmet coffee shop, socializes with everyone, and loves to travel? yeah, that’s compatibility numerology between a 3 and 5. it’s kind of awesome because… we already know that 3’s are fabulous communicators who totally rule when it comes to helping others. 5’s free spirit can go right along for that ride! between the two of you, your numerology love match will always have tons of fun, and interesting and entertaining adventures because of your zest for life. can you just see the sparkles flying off the edges of your kaleidoscope life? 3’s and 5’s are not into routines or hard work, so unless you’re professional entertainers or have inherited fortunes, you will have to get down with finding the right career where that will provide enough variety to keep you from getting bored. 3 and 6 in love as far as compatibility numerology goes, we could say 3, you really scored if you are in a love match with a 6! 6 is the motherhood number: peaceful, caring, nurturing, protecting, and teaching. this natural combination almost always works well together. 3 is very enthusiastic sky rockets in sight! and 6 will provide support and stability home sweet home. you should be aware in your numerology love match there might be some problems. the problem could occur if 6 becomes jealous of your naturally flirtatious ways, 3. be sensitive to that, and 6, don’t get so involved in mothering that you begin mothering your partner. not everybody and maybe not your 3 will recognize that you’re just trying to help. when a 3 is busy talking up a good gab about any subject, your 6 will recognize you’re talking too much and working too little and will nudge you along. 3, you need that nudge, because, as you know, you can get distracted easily. your 6 is a hard worker! in your compatibility numerology, the two of you can help others 3’s will draw them in with charm, and 6 will counsel them from the heart. perfectamundo! 3 and 7 in love compatibility numerology between a 3 and a 7 is all about opposites, baby. 3’s like to be on the go and this may be unbearable for 7’s, who like solitude. and, while 3’s love social situations, 7’s are never quite comfortable there. as you can see, there’s that whole “opposites attract” vibe going on. while you’re at lunch with your friends, 3, your 7 is at home contemplating the meaning of life, why we are here, and guess what, darling? your 7 will never quit on this quest for knowledge, so you may as well let him. you guys can make it work if you don’t try to force your mate into participating with you in what you absolutely love doing that they do not. you may find some simpatico in the arts as you both have a natural love of them. 3 don’t talk to your 7 in the museum, though or during an intense movie!. be happy that you are together in life, and love that your strengths compliment one another’s weak spots. ladies, if you are a 3 in a numerology love match with a 7, he will appreciate your beauty, but he will never be a fashion plate. think rumpled and comfortable vs. high fashion. 3 and 8 in love in order to be happy, the 8 will require authority and goals while 3 will require stimulation, attention and freedom. can compatibility numerology happen for a 3 and 8? it can if you are willing to understand one another and allow each other to be authentic and back away completely from any attempt to change the other. it’s c’est la vie time. 3, you’ve got to love the 8’s emphasis on career, business, finances or authority. 8, that 3 in your numerology love match, hasn’t learned to make the wisest decisions yet that you can make in a snap. be gentle with your little 3! play nice. a 3 is most happy just finding ways to be happy, and if the 8 can allow, approve and tolerate this while you’re happily hard at work, then you’ve got numerology compatibility! 3, cherish your 8 because while they may be gorgeous, they may also not be especially romantic based on their straight-forwardness. trust this though: your 8 will love and support you as you pursue, say, an entrepreneurial business where you’ve got your freedom. your 8 will balance out any sense of overwhelm you might feel. 3 and 9 in love as far as compatibility numerology is concerned, this match can be excellent because both people in the relationship will engage one another. let’s be real… 3’s and 9’s like to be on stage and have a natural interest in people. brad and angelina in the days when that was working i wonder what really happened…. take a look at the roundness at the top of the numeral 9. that’s a symbol of 9 offering generously all he’s got to the world at large. 9 is a great understander who loves life and is grateful to have a peaceful 3 to live and play with! a 9 can also nudge a 3 along to help them follow through on their commitments or stick with a career. 3’s could learn a lot from 9’s… they think of “work” as play! when the 3 “slacks off”, the 9 might feel obligated to fix it…you forgot to scoop the cat box again? on the other hand, even though the 9 is caring, the 3 might find them a little distant at times. if the 3 and 9 can help each other out in all areas, they can have some amazing compatibility numerology. just sayin’ 3 and 9 in love as far as compatibility numerology is concerned, this match can be excellent because both people in the relationship will engage one another. let’s be real… 3’s and 9’s like to be on stage and have a natural interest in people. brad and angelina in the days when that was working i wonder what really happened…. take a look at the roundness at the top of the numeral 9. that’s a symbol of 9 offering generously all he’s got to the world at large. 9 is a great understander who loves life and is grateful to have a peaceful 3 to live and play with! a 9 can also nudge a 3 along to help them follow through on their commitments or stick with a career. 3’s could learn a lot from 9’s… they think of “work” as play! when the 3 “slacks off”, the 9 might feel obligated to fix it…you forgot to scoop the cat box again?

this is probably the most commonly asked question i get as a weightloss coach! its normally. belly or bingo wings i’m asked about we cannot spot reduce or chose where we lose our fat from, it is different for everyone. some people it comes off their belly first, some their face, we can’t chose. no amount of crunches or planks are going to make your tummy fat disappear faster if you aren’t in a deficit and consistent!! trust the process, chose a sustainable calorie intakediet, stick to it as consistently as you can, with consistent movement and the fat will start to come off and if you do this for long enough it will come off the desired areas. what you can do, is adopt a training regime also, stick to it consistently and build yourself a physique you are happy with when you have removed the overlying body fat. so remember kids, consistency is key! you put on the weight by consistently overeatingdrinking, it wont vanish by eating a salad and doing some crunches much love! step 3 1000 calories what will your day look like today on plan?

though pure essential oils don’t leave an oily spot, some oils can leave a stain due to the naturally occurring darker or yellowish coloring from the original botanicals. so be careful using these essential oils around your favorite white layering tee. fyi: these oils may stain your diffuser depending on the oil and the amount you use. be sure to clean your diffuser after each use! stretching is just as important as lifting. 90days challenge with our “triple threat” products he went from 292lbs to 264lbs happy friday! rise and grind have you tried our raspberry instant detox tea??

me: i have scenario 1: maybe you’ve started off strong in 2021 and started setting goals and buying new workout gear. somewhere along the way, you began to fade—to be honest it’s almost spring and no progress. scenario 2: you might even have started working out but the problem is sticking to it and you are still eating everything you see or not eating at all scenario 3: you are motivated but you do not have any accountability partners. you’re not alone. forming new, healthy habits—or breaking old bad ones—involves multiple steps. first step, action! do! join me in this short term 15 day, two week, body transformation challenge to increase positive behavior changes and form some healthy habits. you have until march 15th to sign up. i got so used to seeing and weighing myself at 61 kgs. although i hustle hard, and make working out a habit daily there are also a lot of factors and inevitable stressors that come my way. although i maintained at 61 kgs, i'm not losing the extra grams either. i struggle with dieting eversince because i feel so deprived with food, but with the help of usana products believe it or not, i lost 2 kilos in just 13 days. yes. it can happen. usana can do wonders but you also have to put discipline first. too. drop me a message to see how it works for me. asking is free and you wouldn't know if you don't ask if you have been hesitant about trying herbalife to assist you towards your health and wellness goals your fit friends, @mrzspkates and i, are here to help. order in for me and some customers so thought i'd show you. all the for nicole mccarren masone looking her best after 14 months of consistent use good morning breakfast time we are open now 9710 franklin ave franklin park illinois 60131 meal prepping for the win this week. my husband was able to still make us a delicious healthy low carb meal for dinner when i had to work late. it definitely helps keeps us on plan. no. i won't even bother taking part on this or start this if this was mlm. i'm an introvert and hardcore on my alone time so, chasing after people is definitely not my thing. we do not operate like the traditional mlm multi-level marketing, pyramid method, get-rich-quick-101. the traditional mlm typically uses pushy methods such as cold calling, door to door, pushing friends and family to get involved, and meeting quotas weeklymonthly in order to get paid or keep the rank. the business model i use focuses on direct sales, franchise-like model. it is user-friendly and it teaches attraction marketing law of attraction. we use social media to attract like-minded people globally to find quality and right people who are already interested to start and change their lives for the better. i don’t sell anything or have to hunt and force people down. the money we earn are definitely not based on ranks, too and i can guarantee you that the “people at the top” do not see a penny of my hardwork and efforts. all sales tools, training, unlimited mentorship are provided for us. they get updated from time to time, depending on how social media platforms update theirs. that’s how we adapt with the ever-changing world, because change is inevitable. we have to keep up with it. what amazes me is i don’t have to reach out to people. people even the ones i don't know reach out to me and ask for information while i’m enjoying my solitude at home. would you like to learn how to start? sign up on the link in bio for free intro and it might resonate with you, or feel free to dm me too. fizz it!!!! as someone who wears glasses, i know firsthand how important it is to look after my eyes, especially since i am on my phone all the time with pharmanex eye formula you can help protect your eyes from damaging blue light. raise your hand if you need this?

being very particular with your measurements when making any type of pastry is key to the success of it. for example weighing too much butter in shortcrust pastry, as pictured, can put you at risk of frying the pastry rather than baking it as there is too much fat in it. and too much water can cause cracks and splits in the pastry. do you need any other advice when it comes to pastry??

i then found out about building you own team it’s pretty simple you just teach people what you are doing as a rep yourself. when i joined avon in 2014 i already had my own cleaning business, a complex bereavement counsellor, plus my friend had managed to get me back into retail part time life was super busy and to be honest another job was really not what i wanted or needed at that time in my life. i soon found out that avon rewards and their incentives are amazing from bonuses to holidays. don’t get me wrong, you have to work like you do for anything in life if you want to maximise the rewards and your personal goals. it’s been one hell of a journey and now i am in the financial position where i earn more than my husband, we are secure and we can now live off my wage alone. we found this out in 2019 when my husband had a heart attack coming off a beach in cornwall. i was able to take 5 weeks off while he was in hospital and then provided for us for nearly a year after while he was recovering. he is self employed so we were hit financially hard but we didn’t have to worry due to the size of my business i had built with avon. with avon the possibilities are endless from treating the family to building a career. if you have the mindset to achieve your goals on your terms avon will be for you xx @avonuk i am passionate about helping people.... i’m getting these life saving products in the hands of the people who need them...... and that is everyone coach lash bae life changer dm to find out more we are not giving out discounts today!!!! start today! it starts with your mindset decision to make a change. would love to connect with u if you ready??

just like everyone else, i have my off days, but i am self disciplined. i am not always motivated to do anything, but i am disciplined. it took me a while to get to this point, but everyday i am becoming 1 better than the day before. my suggestion: 1. write down you goals for the day. 2. write down your tasks for the day and set aside a time slot for each. 3. set aside some time for yourself everyday e.g. watching your favourite show, reading a book or simply just going for a walk. 4. write down everything you are grateful for everyday this helped me a lot over the last 6 weeks. 5. do what's best for you!

good habits are easy to create and stick to on our program! so very rewarding becoming your best self!!! start from the inside and glow on the outside! regain your confidence!! it’s the best feeling in the world!! i am so guilty of this, but working to improve daily. repeating actions: we have all done this, repeating the same actions over and over again, hoping this time they will work. this does not get you any closer to your goal. you need to look at your previous unsuccessful efforts and decide what to change!

simply put, they are the playground in which we seek to love and be loved and experience the process of attachment and separation. sometimes, however, we get stuck on the merry-go-round; round and round we go, not knowing how to jump off, change the direction of things, andor try a different ride. comfort and familiarity can be our worst enemy. the “why” we do this is largely a function of what we were exposed to and absorbed unconsciously in our family of origin. the rest is just throwing sand into the wind, sometimes in the direction of our partner sometimes at ourselves. agree or disagree?

eat similar meals are your portions too big and your digestive system is struggling to cope?try smaller portions and also be mindful of your eating speed to reduce that bloat. cook your vegetables don't eat them raw. raw vegetables can course bloating for some people as they take longer to break down and have more bacteria on the surface. make sure your fibre is in check are you eating enough fibre and helping your digestive system along? get more fibre in your diet rice, berries and beans. probiotics digestive enzyme you can get these in supplement format and they help digestion. drink hot water tea soothing teas are always great for setting your stomach. i recommend herbalife belly combo. get a sweat in go workout and get that bloating down, get your blood pumping and help your body process properly. does this help?

good food needs good company. i like to spend as much time as possible with this guy when he's home. shift work means less time together without kids, so we try to make the most of it. when we don't, our relationship takes a hit. we definitely notice a difference in how we treat each other when we're making sure we spend time together vs when we do our own thing. sometimes this means putting our to do list aside and being ok with it something i am working on. sometimes it means going to bed earlier than we wanted to. sometimes it means watching a show we don't want to watch we have very different tastes lol. whatever it is, try to spend more quality time with your significant other and you should notice a difference in your relationship! we definitely have. i'm grateful for the time i get to spend with my other half and for not having to worry about coordinating 2 schedules to get this time in! have a great weekend and don't forget tomorrow is daylight savings time!

because both people value feeling safe and secure. and, since both partners have similar personalities, it makes for an in-sync pair! a numerology number 4 love match holds a masculine energy. these two thrive on systems, structure, discipline, and good old hard work. this pair would be happy sitting together in the den reading books in silence for hours. for 4’s, it’s heaven on earth not to have a chatty kathy on their arm! and since both people are planners, their finances would be well managed. for example, their retirement accounts should be fabulous since both enjoy discipline and planning. plus, many 4’s enjoy craftsmanship, so imagine what gorgeous furniture these two could conjure up together! the admiration this couple has for each other’s character can lead to passionate appreciation! this can be a challenging match, as 4’s tend to be direct and to the point while 5’s tend to be more diplomatic. also, a numerology number 4 will never find predictability in a 5. 4’s haaaate change and 5’s need it to be happy. as far as personality, 5 is the ultimate free spirit, while 4 is happiest with structure and routine. yet, if this duo can learn the right balance of give and take, they can make it work! for example, the 5 may need to compromise and find a bit more structure. the 4 may have to accept that being on time and making a commitment might never happen with a 5! this is a comfortable match with both people being fairly traditional. the numerology 6 tends to build a harmonious and secure foundation for home and family. the 4 appreciates this stability and discipline it takes to accomplish it. this pair would have fun figuring out how to do things together and ease on down the road hand in hand into the sunset! even more harmony would be created, as this duo is loyal and predictable. if there is one thing these guys cherishes, it’s agreement and both would do whatever it takes to get there. it also helps that the 6 will appreciate the 4’s dry sense of humor… and enjoy his cleverness! 4 and 7 in love both people in this relationship need security to feel happy. although there may not be a lot of fire and passion here, there will be plenty of devotion and loyalty. plus, this couple both have dry senses of humor and will appreciate each other’s clever way with words! another common factor for this team is that they both thrive on logic, and prefer deep conversation to small talk. if kids come into the mix, the 4 would likely be a strict parent with high expectations, while the 7 may be demanding. both may need to be mindful to balance out their level-headedness with a gentle touch. 4 and 8 in love power couple alert! this is a comfortable numerology love match, as both parties want to get ahead and are good at business. number 8 with their big career and business plans, is almost guaranteed success! this energy jives well with the goal-oriented numerology number 4. in this relationship, the 4 tends to be a cautious planner, while the 8 tends to be more grandiose… a very complimentary pair! since the numerology number 4 can be a workaholic, it’s good that the 8 can bring balance and realism into the mix. also, both these people would do well in a military career, because, while the 8 can become very successful and prosperous, they’d love to have a 4 to help them with the details… like keeping those shoes 4’s have long-term energy, and the 8 enhances that. in other words, this match would never get bored with the other’s drive and confidence!

practitioners of chinese medicine have used this non-invasive treatment method to help millions of people become well and stay well for thousands of years. single-use, sterile acupuncture needles are placed in acupuncture points to enhance the patient’s capacity to conquer disease, alleviate pain, and find homeostasis. classical chinese medicine stems from an ancient daoist philosophy that views a person as an energy system in which body, mind, and spirit are unified, each influencing and balancing the other. the energy of “qi” chi is present and circulates throughout the body along specific pathways called meridians. illness occurs if energy flow becomes blocked or insufficient. different from western medical approaches, which attempt to isolate and separate a disease from a person, chinese medical philosophy emphasizes a holistic approach that treats the person by addressing the body, mind, and spirit as interrelated and connected. -the chinese acupuncture herbology clinic “where locals go to heal” got questions? just ask! 828.258-9016 how to make how to make good morning yes you can have it all we just sprung ahead into spring let’s celebrate with positivity mhmmm....point to consider ne???? mhmmm....point to consider ne???? mhmmm....point to consider ne???? summer's coming... who can i help? okay so that would be me!! i am most effective when i am open and honest about my own struggles; some of which are painful. when i embrace myself for who i am, it is then that i can use my pain, my life experiences, to serve others. when i am coaching my clients and they have had a bad week, i of course support and encourage them, but i’m also honest and vulnerable with them about my own journey. this open communication between coach and client creates a level of trust and authenticity. i take my struggles and embrace my ability to have compassion, which allows me to connect on a deeper level because i’ve been there too. i have had periods in my life where all of the people around me have been critical and i felt like i wasn’t enough. that kind of an environment tears people down and affects personal growth. but then came this new opportunity for health, self-care and community. i found my people the group of people around me that truly support me and loved me for who i am. and the best part? now i get to be that for others needing the same kind of support. we weren’t meant to go through our struggles alone, we were meant to have a group. so who are your people? what do you believe is holding you back in your personal growth or business? could it be that the one major obstacle in your life could actually be your strength? @kat.cootware schedule a free health audit or to talk about partnering with me! www.calendly.comcootware w o w-amazing results like for a chat today let's talk about it 𝐒𝐀𝐌𝐄 𝐃𝐑𝐄𝐒𝐒 𝐍𝐄𝐖 𝐂𝐎𝐍𝐅𝐈𝐃𝐄𝐍𝐂𝐄 ms harriet jones looking fire as perusal 𝐉𝐔𝐋𝐘 𝐌𝐀𝐑𝐂𝐇 results insane right?

link in my bio! meet morgan... are you spending under sun, 10 to 20 minutes a day? i just keep walking with book in hand, under sun for 15 to 20 minutes everyday. since lock down started we started adjusting to new way of life. part of that most people are working from home, hang on to the laptops as soon as wake up, meeting after meeting day passes by. there is no chance to go out or terrace to spend some time under sun due to busy at work which promotes mental dullness slowly. read how? our brain releases important hormones melatonin and seratonin in sync with nature. we must have more seratonin during day to be active and more melatonin during night to get sound sleep. being not exposed to sun, brain is dominated by melatonin entire day keeps us lethargic and also causes not sufficient melatonin during night which leads to insomnia sleep deprived. so let us spend 20 minutes under sun in the morning make our brain suppresses melatonin and increases seratonin. then we can have perfect day. now you know how you can make day energetic wonderful night with sound sleep. have a lovely time and live healthy young bam! today is four weeks my health journey. i started at 313lbs. so down 15 lbs in a month! so stoked! also, i have lost 3 12 inches around my waist. i have to go buy a belt today. bam! today is four weeks my health journey. i started at 313lbs. so down 15 lbs in a month! so stoked! also, i have lost 3 12 inches around my waist. i have to go buy a belt today. the gems are back at it! movie night on another level diamonds pearls orange shake and tablets down to set the tone for a great day! for those that ask what herbalife tablets i take.. allum days down pounds bunny bunny bunny bunny... bunny! what team are you?

she was insecure. lacked confidence. depressed. unhealthy. shamed. embarrassed. fubu fat, ugly, black uncomfortable. well that’s how i felt i used to loveeeee taking photos until i became that person. long story short i realized that no one can make me genuinely happy with myself. only i had the capability to do so. so i made a commitment to myself! i become a total life changer today i’m happy to say that i am a “product of the products”! i let that hurt go! i feel great. i’m transforming mentally physically and making money while doing it! this is just the beginning of my journey stayed tuned peace blessings with properties that help to soothe the mind and body, the warm, woody scent of cedarwood oil promotes a relaxing environment when used topically or aromatically. cedarwood essential oil has clarifying properties and is frequently used in massage therapy. primary benefits: 1 cedarwood oil naturally repels insects 2 creates a comforting and relaxing environment 3 helps to keep skin looking healthy change. do you chase it or run away from it? if change wasn’t big or shocking, then it wouldn’t be much of a change at all. change mostly happens at the most defining moments of our life. the older i get, the more i realize that change doesn’t happen in an instant, certain types of change don’t always occur in a single moment. life is a constant wave of change, how we deal with it plots our course. the journey of going from being a corporate employee to owning your own business being your own boss isn’t supposed to be easy. what it takes to actually run your own business, set your own schedule, have full control of how you plan manage your day-to-day, that process of change takes some time to perfect. one example i like to use is usain bolt. he trained since he was just 14 years old for the olympics. fourteen. one thing he likes to say is that he trained his entire life just to run for 9 seconds. the process of training to become a winner is what makes him a 1st place champion. did he win because he expects it, or did he win because he worked for it? when looking at your own journey the only one that matters anyway be gentle on yourself if you don’t like where you are yet. keep breaking your own personal ceilings breakthrough to the person you are meant to grow into. remember that change is a process, not a single event. shift gears into the online space summer is coming the ever popular tummy tox plan comprising the boosters and protein shakes. this is one of our cheapest and most effective packages for weight loss. if your goal is to come out of lock down looking feeling your best, this plan is for you taking orders secure your place, spaces running out fast dm for details no filters, just me. love who you are. self-care! don’t change for anyone! no filters, just me. love who you are. self-care! don’t change for anyone! new week tomorrow!! week 2 of our 21 day challenge is about to start! new week tomorrow!! week 2 of our 21 day challenge is about to start! back fat does this sound familiar while some of us have trouble making our belly fat disappear other people can't rid their bodies of back fat no matter how hard they try also referred to as a bra bulge, back fat is that that annoying band of chub that clings to the back muscles and creates a fold of skin above the waistline or a bulge that peeks out of a bra band i had no idea that i had this issue thanks to my husband who didn’t tell me when i wanted to wear a back revealing halloween costume 7 years ago to work he persuaded me to wear something else much to my horror fast forward 6 years and i looked at myself in the mirror i was shocked what causes back fata lack of cardio exercise or a sedentary lifestyle can contribute to back fat a diet that's high in sodium or sugar can also contribute to inflammation in your body, making back fat and “bloat” appear to be more significant omg this was me when i reached out to my friend and started my health journey a little more than a year ago i began to notice my back fat subsiding yay me i’m still on that optimal health journey now helping others with there issues that they might not have known about either back fat does this sound familiar while some of us have trouble making our belly fat disappear other people can't rid their bodies of back fat no matter how hard they try also referred to as a bra bulge, back fat is that that annoying band of chub that clings to the back muscles and creates a fold of skin above the waistline or a bulge that peeks out of a bra band i had no idea that i had this issue thanks to my husband who didn’t tell me when i wanted to wear a back revealing halloween costume 7 years ago to work he persuaded me to wear something else much to my horror fast forward 6 years and i looked at myself in the mirror i was shocked what causes back fata lack of cardio exercise or a sedentary lifestyle can contribute to back fat a diet that's high in sodium or sugar can also contribute to inflammation in your body, making back fat and “bloat” appear to be more significant omg this was me when i reached out to my friend and started my health journey a little more than a year ago i began to notice my back fat subsiding yay me i’m still on that optimal health journey now helping others with there issues that they might not have known about either there are others depending on your transformation looking for 5 ladiesgents who are ready for a change! nutrition programs are available according to your goals spending budget.. comment below or send me a dm ig mstee.goherbalife.com 10 x 50 kg's health is wealth 10 x 50 kg's health is wealth when your dreams goals are way bigger than your desires to sleep you will be successful another life about to change by starting an amazing journey- how exciting is this process goosebump moments everytime 5 x 55 kg's health is wealth do you love earning freebies, rewards, and exclusive items?!??

they count. start with your mindset. build the discipline. turn fear into growth. change the excuses with opportunities. so, choose wisely, and start creating the life you want! that is the beauty of my business. if i dont work.. i dont get paid. even on vacation i'm placing orders for my customers. the grind never stops. super blessed to have the opportunity to do this business. 21 day challenge starts today. spots are still open. message me today to get your plan. let's go so so so proud!
